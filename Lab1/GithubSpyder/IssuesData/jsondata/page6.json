thread details the current state of the custom editor proposal delivered with VS Code 1.39. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe custom editor API will provide a framework for extensions to create fully customizable read/write editors that are used in place of VS Code's standard text editor for specific resources. A XAML custom editor, for example, could show a WYSIWYG style editor for your `.xaml` files. Our end goal is to give extensions the most flexibility possible while keeping VS Code fast, lean, and consistent.\r\n\r\nThis iteration, we are sharing the first pieces of the custom editor API proposal: readonly, webview-based custom editors. Here's a quick overview of the currently proposed API:\r\n\r\n### Contributing a custom editor\r\n\r\nA webview-based custom editor binds a resource (a file) to a [webview](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview) provided by an extension. This webview replaces VS Code's default text/binary editor for that resource.\r\n\r\nConsider an extension that previews images. To create webview-based editor, our extension first uses the proposed `webviewEditors` contribution point to tell VS Code about the custom editors it provides:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"contributes\": {\r\n  \"webviewEditors\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"viewType\": \"myExtension.imagePreview\",\r\n      \"displayName\": \"My Image Preview\",\r\n      \"priority\": \"default\",\r\n      \"selector\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"filenamePattern\": \"*.{jpg,jpe,jpeg,png,bmp,gif,ico,tga,webp}\",\r\n          \"mime\": \"image/*\"\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n},\r\n\"activationEvents\": [\r\n  \"onWebviewEditor:myExtension.imagePreview\"\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe important properties are:\r\n\r\n* `viewType` - Unique identifier for the editor. This is also used in the extension code later. Note this identifier is also used in the activation event.\r\n* `displayName` - Human readable name of the custom editor.\r\n* `priority` - Determines if the custom editor should be enabled by default.\r\n* `selector`- Specifies when the editor should be enabled.\r\n  * `filenamePattern` - A glob pattern to identify file names that enable the editor.\r\n  * `mime` - A glob pattern for mime types that enable the editor (this is used if you open a data URI resource, such as from Git history).\r\n\r\nThe `onWebviewEditor:myExtension.imagePreview` [activationEvent](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/activation-events) ensures that our extension is activated whenever VS Code determines it should show our custom image preview editor.\r\n\r\nWe then use the proposed `registerWebviewEditorProvider` API to bind our `viewType` to a resolver that takes a resource and a webview editor. This resolve is invoked whenever a resource that matches the selector for the custom editor is opened:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport * as vscode from 'vscode';\r\n\r\nexport function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {\r\n    context.subscriptions.push(vscode.window.registerWebviewEditorProvider(\r\n        'myExtension.imagePreview',\r\n        {\r\n            async resolveWebviewEditor(resource: vscode.Uri, editor: vscode.WebviewEditor): Promise<void> {\r\n                // Take ownership of webview and create its content\r\n                editor.webview.html = `...`;\r\n            }\r\n        })\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's it! At this point, our extension can use the `editor` just like a normal [webview](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview).\r\n\r\n### Custom editor UX\r\n\r\nWe've also added proposed UX for managing custom editors.\r\n\r\nThe new **Reopen With** command allows you to change which editor is used for the current resource. This will close the existing editor and reopen it with the selected editor.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the `workbench.experimental.editorAssociations` setting lets you control which custom editor is used for a given resource. It is a list of file selectors bound to the editor `viewType` that should be opened when a resource matches the selector:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"workbench.experimental.editorAssociations\": [\r\n  {\r\n    \"filenamePattern\": \"*.png\",\r\n    \"viewType\": \"myExtension.imagePreview\",\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that `default` is also a valid `viewType` and can be used to force VS Code to open its normal text/binary editor instead of any default custom editor:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"workbench.experimental.editorAssociations\": [\r\n  {\r\n    \"filenamePattern\": \"*.png\",\r\n    \"viewType\": \"default\",\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Next steps for custom editors\r\n\r\nCustom editors are an exciting and potentially powerful new extension point. We want to be sure we that we get the API right so that extensions can build new experiences without degrading VS Code's performance or deviating from some of our core UX principles.\r\n\r\nThe current proposal is only a first step and will likely be heavily revised. We will continue to iterate on the custom editor API over the coming months."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/82113","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/82113/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/82113/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/82113/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/82113","id":504186888,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MDQxODY4ODg=","number":82113,"title":"Screencast mode does not work with webviews","user":{"login":"DonJayamanne","id":1948812,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDg4MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1948812?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonJayamanne","html_url":"https://github.com/DonJayamanne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonJayamanne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonJayamanne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonJayamanne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonJayamanne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonJayamanne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonJayamanne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonJayamanne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonJayamanne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonJayamanne/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODIxOTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODIxOTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2019-10-08T17:49:49Z","updated_at":"2019-10-08T18:28:25Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->\r\n<!-- Also please test using the latest insiders build to make sure your issue has not already been fixed: https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/ -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Use Help > Report Issue to prefill these. -->\r\n* Version: 1.39.0-insider\r\n* Commit: c8252b63f547674d2faf361d4181bb76b0b5f81a\r\n* Date: 2019-10-04T09:23:20.797Z\r\n* Electron: 4.2.10\r\n* Chrome: 69.0.3497.128\r\n* Node.js: 10.11.0\r\n* V8: 6.9.427.31-electron.0\r\n* OS: Darwin x64 18.7.0\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\r\n\r\n1.

Recently I found that, when press <kbd>F5</kbd> and enter extention debugging, and use `console.log` to output a variable which is actually `Infinity`, the `Debug Console` showed it as `null` instead of `Infinity`. This is confusing and seems buggy.\r\n\r\nI tried a newly created extension project from `yo code` template, it is still the same.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7011247/66399539-62d5cb00-ea12-11e9-8c5a-85ba5b81e01c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nin `Debug Console`:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7011247/66399585-7aad4f00-ea12-11e9-9eb2-ccee79a13724.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Use Help > Report Issue to prefill these. -->\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.38.1\r\n- OS Version: macOS 10.14.4\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. create a template extension project follow this [official guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension)\r\n2. add test script in `activate` method:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconsole.log('Congratulations, your extension \"test-ext\" is now active!');\r\nconst a: number = Infinity;\r\nconsole.log(a, null, a === null);\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. press <kbd>F5</kbd> to enter extension debugging;\r\n4. run this extension command to activate the extension;\r\n5. check the `Debug Console` in source project window.
