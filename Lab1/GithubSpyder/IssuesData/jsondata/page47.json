It was completely failing the update each time due to \"ERRO Bad arguments: Code path doesn't seem to exist.\"  The path it provides is indicative of the underlying error though:\r\n\r\nD:\\Users\\FIRST.LAST\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code\\%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code\\Code.exe\r\n\r\nChecking Registry, this is the path it reflects in HKEY_USERS\\ID\\Environment\\Path,  HKEY_USERS\\ID\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\Applications\\code.exe\\DefaultIcon, and most other path instances and also what it updates the shortcut to on every update attempt.\r\n\r\nIt's even worse in VSCodeSourceFile\\shell\\open\\command:\r\n\r\n\"\"D:\\Users\\FIRST.LAST\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code\\%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code\\Code.exe\" \"%1\"%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code\\Code.exe\" \"%1\"\r\n\r\nLooking into the actual folder, I see that it somehow created a folder based on the environment variable.

However, what you can do with that in practice is limited, since the insertion will always be the same no matter which commit character was used.\r\n\r\nIt would be very powerful if the insertion could vary depending on which commit character was selected (`insertText`, `additionalTextEdits`).\r\n\r\nHere's an example of one of the use cases we wanted to support in the Haxe extension:\r\n\r\n- When inserting an unimported type, we have two options: generate an import via `additionalTextEdits`, or insert the fully qualified path instead. You don't always want the same behavior here, so it would be neat if you could for instance:\r\n    - use <kbd>Enter</kbd> to generate the import and insert the unqualified name\r\n    - use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to insert the fully qualified name\r\n- Right now, there's two workarounds:\r\n    - Duplicate each completion item, so you have one for auto-importing and one for inserting fully quallified names. However, this would make for a very messy completion list, so we don't do this in the Haxe extension.\r\n   - Have a setting that controls which behavior should be used. We _do_ have this in the Haxe extension, but as mentioned before, sometimes you want to decide which one to use \"in the moment\", without having to mess with settings.\r\n\r\nThere's precedent for this sort of behavior in other IDEs. For instance in IntelliJ (Java), you can use <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> to open a code action menu _on completion items_. There you can for instance choose to import a method statically:\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Udt5Ofp.png)\r\n\r\nPerhaps allowing \"code actions\" on completion items like that is better than basing it purely on which commit character was used, as it's much more explicit.\r\n\r\nThoughts?"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/70820","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/70820/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/70820/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/70820/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/70820","id":423158086,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MjMxNTgwODY=","number":70820,"title":"show

I have enough information to do a search and replace and resolve it on my own, but it would be much more convenient if I had some way to ask VS Code to resolve it, either by giving some form of access to [variableResolver.ts](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/services/configurationResolver/common/variableResolver.ts) or having WorkspaceConfiguration resolve the
