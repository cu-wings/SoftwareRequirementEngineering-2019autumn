Opening `/foo/bar.zip/package.json` would succeed. Read-only is likely fine, at least for a first iteration.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\n- This feature isn't unheard of. Both vim and [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/File-Archives.html) support reading files from zip archives (they even go a bit farther by allowing to also edit them, but we might not want to have to deal with the UI complexity for now).\r\n\r\n- Package managers are experimenting with virtual install folders. Being able to read third-party files from the archives that contain them will be important to provide a good developer experience (particularly for the \"ctrl+click on a symbol to go to its definition\" workflow). Zip will be used by Yarn because of its good random access properties.\r\n\r\n## Suggested Implementation\r\n\r\n- The Yarn project ships a [wasm build](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/tree/master/packages/berry-libzip) of the libzip as an external package. This would make it easy to use a battle-tested zip library at little cost.\r\n\r\n- The size cost would be around ~300KB for the Zip implementation (which could be reused for other purposes - there's a bunch of things that could use Zip support down the road).\r\n\r\n- You might actually already have a library able to do that?\r\n\r\n## Why not an extension\r\n\r\n- I've started working on an extension to help with that ([vscode-zipfs](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/tree/master/packages/vscode-zipfs)), but it cannot be integrated as well as I'd like. In particular, it doesn't work with the ctrl+click workflow I mentionned, and running `code /foo/bar.zip/package.json` cannot open the right file. I believe a builtin integration could provide a seamless integration, which would be beneficial to the users.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75527","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75527/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75527/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75527/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/75527","id":456368741,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NTYzNjg3NDE=","number":75527,"title":"Utilize Typescript for GDPR Annotations","user":{"login":"lramos15","id":4544166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDQxNjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4544166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lramos15","html_url":"https://github.com/lramos15","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lramos15/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lramos15/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lramos15/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lramos15/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lramos15/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lramos15/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lramos15/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lramos15/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lramos15/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODkzOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"dcdcdc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"kieferrm","id":4674940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzQ5NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4674940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm","html_url":"https://github.com/kieferrm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"kieferrm","id":4674940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzQ5NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4674940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm","html_url":"https://github.com/kieferrm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2019-06-14T18:00:43Z","updated_at":"2019-08-06T17:32:48Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Currently GDPR annotations are created with hand typed JSON comments.

Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nThe Find all References function isn't working as of VScode 1.35. It worked fine in 1.34.\r\n\r\nI'm using it on typescript, and VScode has decided to use its built-in typescript engine. I haven't touched its settings. Our typescript compiles absolutely fine, so code-wise there isn't a problem. Intellisense also works perfectly, so the editor is definitely able to fetch references.\r\n\r\nWhen I use Find all References on an imported function from lodash, I get only the references in the current file, and the one in `lang.d.ts`. I would expect to see references across our project instead.\r\n\r\nWhen I use this function on any function imported from another file *within* our project (in other words, not an external module), it works as expected and I get to see all references in all files.\r\n\r\nWe're importing from lodash like so:\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { isFunction } from 'lodash';\r\n```\r\nWhich again, works absolutely fine. The fact that VScode can find the `lang.d.ts`, tells me that it knows what to search for. It just doesn't want to find references in all other files.\r\n\r\nAs for one that does work:\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { superCoolCustomFunction } from 'superCool';\r\n```\r\nThere, the Find all References function works perfectly.\r\n\r\nAgain, the code compiles just fine, and works as expected, so it's not like lodash cannot be found or anything.\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.35.0

VSCode Version: 1.35.0 current stable release\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10 1903 (May update) build 18362.175\r\n\r\nIssue details:\r\nI installed VS Code like 24 hours ago and shut down and started it a few times during the day, working to full satisfaction. But now, a couple of minutes ago, it randomly, while VS code was open in the background (taskbar), thrown an error without having actively interacted with VS code interface for a while. Only a .lua file was open.\r\n\r\nThe error seems to reveal that VS code was attempting to uninstall itself. Without my consent or direct action to set this in motion. Or maybe it was somehow, suddenly, writing the uninstall file while not supposed to, as the active usage scenario shouldn't relate to the uninstaller.\r\n\r\nTo understand my point, view the image of said warning below:\r\n![VScode_bug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12105539/59385567-efbe8f80-8d64-11e9-96a2-fabad2ec7b20.png)\r\n\r\nI clicked abort, and I'm unsure what would have happened if I clicked something else.. even though it may impact people that dismiss the messsage differently in a more severe way. I really didnt want to lose my perfectly set-up configuration/plugins, so I wasn't going to risk it just for the purpose of providing more info in a bug report.\r\n\r\nI hope that even though it's a random and sudden issue and pretty trivial, you appreciate the report as it allows you to investigate scenarios in which the uninstaller can start leading its own life without user action. It's certainly a bug, I'm very aware of my menu and interface actions around the time that popup appeared.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A (random issue)\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: N/A (cannot find out since issue is random)\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75361","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75361/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75361/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75361/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/75361","id":455369729,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NTUzNjk3Mjk=","number":75361,"title":"VS Code cannot handle network drives when run as Administrator","user":{"login":"justinTM","id":9123665,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMjM2NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9123665?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinTM","html_url":"https://github.com/justinTM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinTM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinTM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinTM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinTM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinTM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinTM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinTM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinTM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinTM/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":748083956,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NDgwODM5NTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/nodejs","name":"nodejs","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":286886536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyODY4ODY1MzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/upstream","name":"upstream","color":"dcdcdc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMDY5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMDY5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2019-06-12T18:49:37Z","updated_at":"2019-06-13T19:20:20Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Steps to reproduce: run VS code as administrator. attempt to open any folder or file on a mapped network drive (e.g., 'Y:\\').

With index.ts closed, run the Custom watch task \r\n2. The Problems view shows the TS compiler error, notably with EG(2554) as the error code, indicating the source is from the Custom watch task problemMatcher. Click on the error to open index.ts.\r\n3. The Problems view now shows one TS compiler error, with ts(2554), indicating the source is from the $tsc problemMatcher.\r\n4. Closing the file (without fixing the error) clears the error from the Problems list, even though the Custom watch task has applyTo: allDocuments property. \r\n5. If I set the owner to be \"nottypescript\", then the error appears twice in the Problems view and the one generated by my Custom watch problemMatcher remains when I close the file without fixing the error.\r\n\r\nThe Problems view should not be overwritten by the $tsc problemMatcher (as in step 3). \r\n\r\nI want the Custom watch task behavior to overwrite the built-in TS task behavior, which is why I set the owner to be typescript so that I can have the error remain as long the error exists, whether or not the file is open. (Ideally, the typescript task would apply to all files, not just open ones in the workspace.)\r\n\r\nI also have a reprorepo here where the issue occurs: https://github.com/erinha/reprorepo\r\n\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes\r\nDoes this issue occur with the Insiders build?

from Atom, I cannot come to terms with how the \"find\" widget appears in the top-right of my screen, barely visible, with a weird dropdown to toggle replace option, and then the search in files has a completely different UX and is displayed at the bottom in a panel (or sidebar).\r\n\r\nThe find & replace, both in current file and globally, is one of the things in Atom that was done really well. You often have to switch from finding in a file to finding across all files, and the current experience in VS Code is simply subpar and inefficient.\r\n\r\nI've searched for extensions that would move the find widget to a panel for consistency but to no avail.\r\n\r\nCan you please consider improving the find UX and move the widget down to the panel for a consistent experience, along with other improvements like:\r\n\r\n- Shared search query between find in file & search in files\r\n- Consistent layout\r\n- Clearer active state for search options\r\n- Buttons to toggle searches with mouse rather than keyboard only\r\n\r\nCompare the two below and judge for yourselves which has the better UX:\r\n\r\n## Atom\r\n\r\n#### Search in files\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/490562/59228883-111c6000-8c2d-11e9-8293-51473f8ea5b1.png)\r\n\r\n- Large search area in panel\r\n- Large buttons for Find all and Replace all\r\n- Replace option always visible and readily available\r\n- Large buttons for search options\r\n- Clear to see which of the options are active by distinct blue highlight colour \r\n\r\n#### Find in file\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/490562/59229057-85570380-8c2d-11e9-9ead-c000c1865a2b.png)\r\n\r\n- Consistent UX compared to search in files, all the options in the same place. \r\n- Big buttons for Find, Find All, Replace, Replace All, \r\n- Replace option always visible and readily available.\r\n- When switching between find in file and search files, the search and replace queries are preserved.\r\n\r\n## VSCode\r\n\r\n#### Search in files\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/490562/59229164-cb13cc00-8c2d-11e9-9434-aff0cd387f8d.png)\r\n\r\n- No action buttons to click for searching (only keyboard activated)\r\n- Search options are small, embedded in the search box, and hard to see if active or not with a thin blue box around them. Not enough contrast.\r\n- Hard to access replace option, always hidden behind the dropdown, despite there being plenty of space beneath the panel\r\n- Unclear how to actually make replacements in file. I literally struggled to figure out how to replace in files the first time I tried to do it.\r\n- We won't talk about how the search results appear in the same panel as that has been covered by many other issues.\r\n\r\n#### Find in file\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/490562/59229390-60af5b80-8c2e-11e9-90d3-99e47ef6f9af.png)\r\n\r\n- Located at the opposite end of the screen, forcing you to switch context from one end of the screen to the other. Very hard to visually see what you're searching as it's hovering over the code in a tiny box.\r\n- Doesn't share search query with search in files, so have to retype it in/rebuild the regex when switching context\r\n- Same problem with tiny search options, poorly distinguishable and hard to see if active\r\n- Replace also inaccessible by default and always have to toggle to open it up"}]
