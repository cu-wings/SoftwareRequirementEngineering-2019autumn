that happens to me and people I've worked with very often is that I change a branch or pull some changes, which changes `package.json`. Often when this happens, it goes unnoticed until some compilation error. It would be extremely helpful if the `Npm support for VS Code` built-in extension could notice when `dependencies`/`devDependencies` in a `package.json` file is changed. It could then display a helpful notification with a \"Run install\" button.\r\n\r\nI think most of the logic for this should already be in place, since the npm extension finds tasks in the workspace already. Adding dependencies as fields it will monitor would hopefully be simple. The main thing would be to monitor when they change as a result of a git operation instead of when the user themselves add packages (manually or via `npm install x`).\r\n\r\n- The notification could be configured on/off via user settings\r\n- The button \"Run install\" could open `npm install` as a task\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n* Is this something that could be considered for the built-in npm extension, or should this be left to a regular extension?  \r\n* If this can be considered for the built-in npm extension, would PR's be welcome?\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/66274","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/66274/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/66274/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/66274/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/66274","id":397326248,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzOTczMjYyNDg=","number":66274,"title":"Cannot close 'Cannot find a program to debug' with mouse click","user":{"login":"dhyey35","id":11143604,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTQzNjA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11143604?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhyey35","html_url":"https://github.com/dhyey35","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhyey35/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhyey35/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhyey35/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhyey35/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhyey35/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhyey35/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhyey35/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhyey35/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhyey35/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129993,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTYxMjk5OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"8D6673","default":true},{"id":291054922,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTEwNTQ5MjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/debug","name":"debug","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTgxNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTgxNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2019-01-09T11:21:44Z","updated_at":"2019-01-09T11:36:33Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nStep 1: Open a node project which does not have a `launch.json`\r\nStep 2: Press F5 and select `Node.js` with mouse left click (don't use keyboard)\r\nStep 3: Modal `Cannot find a program to debug` appears\r\nStep 4: Try closing it with mouse click (don't use `Enter` or `Esc` keys)\r\n\r\nNote: This happens only when `Node.js` in step 2 is done with mouse click.

should scroll\r\nActual: Nothing happens\r\n\r\nRelated issue: I tried to navigate using tab instead of the arrow keys. That looked promising, but it only scrolls down partially through the list. It looks like there's some dynamic loading of further settings that normally happens when using the scroll wheel that doesn't happen when using tab to navigate. In the Insider Build, using tab won't even cause the page to scroll at all.\r\n\r\nGiven both of these issues, navigating through multiple options in the settings page via the keyboard is currently

For example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef func(a,\r\n         |\r\n```\r\n\r\nHitting enter on the first line should stick the cursor where `|` is, not just a single indent. In this second case, it should do a single indent:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef func(\r\n    |\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere appears to only be two ways to handle this:\r\n\r\n- `onEnterRules`\r\n- On-type formatting\r\n\r\nWe'd like to avoid the latter, as we currently support both Jedi and our own language server, which means implementing on-type formatting in two different places (since a single language cannot have multiple on-type formatting providers). Plus, on-type formatting is not enabled by default nor is very popular (and enables a slew of formatting rules other than cursor alignment), so forcing users to enable on-type formatting as a whole would be good to avoid.\r\n\r\nThe other candidate is `onEnterRules`, but it's not powerful enough to be able to do something like this, as:\r\n\r\n- The \"actions\" work in terms of indents, whereas these cursor positions may not be a round multiple of an indent, meaning `appendText` would be required, but...\r\n- `appendText` is only allowed to be a static string, and cannot be generated on the fly.\r\n- Rules are applied using regex to deduce context, which gets unweildy, and even more difficult without #50952.\r\n- Even with something like #17281, there wouldn't be a way to convert a capture group to \"whitespace of the same length of the capture group\" (plus the issue of tab indents).\r\n\r\n\r\nMy initial thought was to allow a function to be provided in `onEnterRules` instead of just specifying `appendText`. For example, something like:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n{\r\n    beforeText: /\\s+def\\s+\\w+\\(\\w+/,  /* not the real regex */\r\n    action: {\r\n        indentAction: IndentAction.None,\r\n        appendText: (document, position, formatOptions, ... /* something */) => calculateIndent(...) // returns a string\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, on closer inspection of how `onEnterRules` works, it appears that it needs to be serializable, so I'm not sure it'd be able to have a callback like the above.\r\n\r\nIs there something that can be added to allow more powerful rules on-enter? Or, is there something that already exists that we've missed?"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/66223","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/66223/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/66223/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/66223/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/66223","id":397044519,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzOTcwNDQ1MTk=","number":66223,"title":"Let me theme diff editor's inserted text background differently in the scroll bar","user":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTMzMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":419891520,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MTk4OTE1MjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/diff-editor","name":"diff-editor","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":272689392,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODkzOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"dcdcdc","default":false},{"id":308114150,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDgxMTQxNTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/themes","name":"themes","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMTQxMjEyNA==","number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODcwNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":1680,"closed_issues":5342,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2019-10-14T16:35:16Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":5,"created_at":"2019-01-08T19:07:25Z","updated_at":"2019-10-12T12:28:24Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Currently `diffEditor.insertedTextBackground` and `diffEditor.removedTextBackground` are used to color both the background in the editor and the decorations in the scrollbar.

Find all references of a symbol**\r\n\r\nVSCode has this already.\r\n\r\n**2. Find all references of a file**\r\n\r\nVSCode has this already, but few know about it, and the process for getting to it is unnecessary. Currently you need to use the \"find all references\" command on an import path that includes the file.\r\n\r\nThis is a very useful feature, and should be made available in the file explorer, for a file's context menu when right clicking it, [as explained here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/66150). Additionally, there should be a command, `References: Find All References of File` as [explained here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/41681).\r\n\r\n**3. Find all references of a folder**\r\n\r\nVSCode does not yet have this feature. When using this on a folder (made available in the context menu), it should show the references for all files inside that folder. A command might be useful here as well (`References: Find All References of Folder`).\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\n\r\nI've already submitted [a feature request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/52845) mentioning this in the past, which was closed and suggested as an extension. However, it looks like I wasn't clear on what my request was, because VSCode has since implemented a lot of this functionality. And it's also clear that there's a lot of confusion around this among VSCode users.\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/66161","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/66161/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/66161/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/66161/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/66161","id":396596920,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzOTY1OTY5MjA=","number":66161,"title":"Extension

Create html file and some elements with their own id like so: `<div id=\"TEXTHERE\">`\r\n2. Create an `<a>` tag with href like this: `<a href=\"#TEXTHERE>content</a>`\r\n3.

are currently two ways to expand a React component.\r\n\r\n1. Type in the opening bracket, begin typing in the component name, accept the suggestion, type in the closing bracket, and then let VSCode's auto closing tag feature do the rest.\r\n\r\n2. Enable the following setting: `\"emmet.triggerExpansionOnTab\": true,`.  After which we can then just start typing the component name, accept either the word or symbol suggestion, and then `tab` again to have Emmet complete the tag.\r\n\r\n**Feature Request**\r\n\r\nI believe option 2 is probably preferable to most. However, I wonder if it'd be possible to remove the requirements of that second `tab`, making it behave more like a normal html tag would in emmet (i.e. accept suggestion and done). In other words, if the accepted suggestion is an imported React component, it will automatically expand the tag without having to trigger it.\r\n\r\n**Side Note**\r\n\r\nThe only reason why we are able to select imported React components at all times from the suggestion list is because of the following setting: `\"editor.wordBasedSuggestions\": true`. Without it, you would only be able to use this when the symbol suggestion appears, which is limited, as [described here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/43266). This is an unnecessary limitation, because an imported component is almost never noise (the [reason given in the docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/emmet#_custom-tags-do-not-get-expanded-in-the-suggestion-list) for why VSCode might ignore suggestions), and should always appear as a suggestion when
