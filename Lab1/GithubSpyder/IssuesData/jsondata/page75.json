Basically, the preview uses the `expandAbbr` function while the final result that's inserted into the editor uses the `expandAbbreviationInRange` function, which are both quite different. The key difference though is that the preview call chain uses the _actual_ text to wrap, while the editor call chain uses the `$TM_SELECTED_TEXT` variable, which doesn't get parsed by the Emmet helper and as such, doesn't recognize that there's a valid url or email that needs to be added to the href attribute.\r\n\r\nHappy to take suggestions on better/alternative

Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nThis references https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1579 which was about the same problem already (originally in the save dialog, but further down also about special filenames from the command line).\r\n\r\nI'm still able to accidentally create hard-to-delete files and folders with VSCode in Windows, which I believe is bad UX and I see an effort to prevent this (e.g. trying to save `NUL` or `abc?*` is actively prevented), so I think this counts as a bug.\r\n\r\n1) Creating invalid folders: Start code.exe/code.bat with a parameter like `C:\\nope...\\wtf.txt`. Good luck getting rid of the folder `nope...` afterwards (worse with `...` alone of course which can end up deleting the whole drive instead if you are not careful). Reason: Seems like you are not validating the directories in the given path.\r\n\r\n2) Creating invalid files: Either start code.exe/code.bat with a parameter like `NUL.txt` or create such a file in the project explorer sidebar. Note that you cannot delete the file even in the sidebar when you created it there! While doing so, by the way, you will notice that upon entering `NUL` an error is shown, but `NUL.txt` is accepted. Reason: Seems like you are comparing against a known list of invalid names and not applying the actual rules.\r\n\r\nA good read about these problems is [this article](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2016/02/the-definitive-guide-on-win32-to-nt.html).\r\n\r\nA solution could be calling `fs.realpath.native`, which uses [`GetFullPathName`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-getfullpathnamew) to get the resolved path (instead of `path.resolve`) and further verifying that the result...\r\n* ...does not start with `\\\\.\\` or `\\\\?\\` (rules out most cases, since for example `C:\\abc\\COM1.txt` would have become `\\\\.\\COM1` at that point)\r\n* ...does not start with `X:\\??\\` where `X` can be any character (rules out the case incorrectly handled by `GetFullPathName` where Windows accepts `\\??\\` as alias for `\\\\?\\`)\r\n* ...does not contain forbidden characters (`:;\\/|<>?*\"`)\r\n...and additionally check that after removing one path segment after another, the above conditions still hold.\r\n\r\n(But yeah I know that this probably won't be worth the effort. It's up to you to decide about that though.)\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code - Insiders 1.28.0-insider (60db21f08b81f03c15bb5c9395755ad3620a62bd, 2018-10-02T13:26:37.890Z)\r\nOS version: Windows_NT x64

searched before adding this feature request.  Apologies if it is a duplicate.\r\nThis request is similar to Remove background color for \"Copy text with formatting\" feature #23734 which is closed.\r\n\r\nI use a dark theme but, when copying to email, MS Word, etc, I don't want the dark background, but I do want the rest of the syntax highlighting.  But, the dark theme may mean that other formatting, when applied to say a white background, would be unreadable.\r\n\r\nA solution would be the ability to specify a default theme when \"Copy text with formatting\".  If that setting is not specified, the current theme would be used (as it is now).  If that setting is specified, I would want that theme to override all my other settings.\r\n\r\nFor example, I use these settings to override my theme (Monokai):\r\n\r\n    \"editor.tokenColorCustomizations\": {\r\n        \"comments\": \"#19fd05\"\r\n    },\r\n  \"workbench.colorCustomizations\": {\r\n    \"editor.background\": \"#000000\"\r\n  },\r\n\r\nI would want those settings to be ignored;  I'm happy with being forced to create (or find) a (light) theme that explicitly sets all the formatting I want for copy text with formatting.\r\n\r\nA 2nd possible option would be to set the default theme as described above, but also allow the selection of a specific theme via a dropdown when the copy is done, say via Cntl-Shift-V or Cntl-Alt-V, or some other key binding."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/59679","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/59679/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/59679/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/59679/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/59679","id":365162631,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNjUxNjI2MzE=","number":59679,"title":"Unable to watch for file changes in this large workspace - not a large workspace.","user":{"login":"jackwootton","id":1623996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjM5OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1623996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackwootton","html_url":"https://github.com/jackwootton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackwootton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackwootton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackwootton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackwootton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackwootton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackwootton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackwootton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackwootton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackwootton/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":622596331,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MjI1OTYzMzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/file-watcher","name":"file-watcher","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":272689423,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODk0MjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"E2A1C2","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMDY5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMDY5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":17,"created_at":"2018-09-29T20:01:54Z","updated_at":"2019-07-13T04:34:56Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.27.2\r\n- OS Version: Ubuntu 18.04 bionic (x86-64)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n0. Create a basic web project with a `node_modules` directory which exceeds the limit of file watchers: \r\n1. Recursively count the number of files in the entire project directory using `find . -type f | wc -l`\r\n2. My project has `44452` files (including directories).\r\n3. Check current limit of file watchers using `cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches`\r\n4. Make a note of the watcher limit of `8192`\r\n5. Configure Visual Studio code to exclude the `node_modules` directory using \r\n```\r\n\"files.watcherExclude\": {\r\n  \"**/node_modules/**\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n6. Count files in only `node_modules` using `find node_modules -type f | wc -l`\r\n7. Make a note of the file count: `43218`\r\n8. Subtract the `node_modules` file count (`43218`) from project file count (`44452`)\r\n9. `44452 - 43218 = 1234`\r\n10. `1234` is well within the watcher limit of `8192`.\r\n11. If VS Code honours `watcherExclude`, it must only watch `1234` files.\r\n11. VS Code still complains it's _\"Unable to watch for file changes in this large workspace\"_.\r\n\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/59678","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/59678/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/59678/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/59678/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/59678","id":365160929,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNjUxNjA5Mjk=","number":59678,"title":"[scss]

Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n1. Fold an area (e.g. a block in JSON) to a line\r\n2. Click the margin of the folded line\r\n3.

If you keep dragging, it will expand the selection to include next line.\r\n\r\n**Workaround**:\r\nClick the beginning of the folded line, drag to the beginning of the next line. It works, but requires much more mouse precision than clicking/dragging in margin area.\r\n\r\n**Suggestion**:\r\nA simple question: how often do you want to select **only** the first line when you click the margin of **folded** area?

If a conflict happens during unstash, merge dialog is shown.\"\r\n* Don't Checkout - just close the dialog and do nothing.\r\n* See the diff of individual modified files by double clicking (or from context menu).

It is useful for editing things like `web.config` files. Our RDP setup allows multiple users to log onto the server using the same account. With most applications this doesn't cause any issues.\r\n\r\nHowever, with VSC we've found that if two users are logged on to the server (with the same user account) and User A has VSC already open then when User B double-clicks on a file to open it in their VSC it actually opens in User A's editor. In other words, every file that User B opens appears in User A's editor and doesn't load in User B's editor at all. This seems very strange! It also potentially a security issue as files that one user is attempting to edit appear in another user's editor, where they might potentially edit it via mistake or reveal sensitive information.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't happen with other editors.

Also I added the `WHERE = 1` at the end to show that the string is considered from the beginning thanks to the presence of `SELECT`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check.
