This happens every time I launch Code.\r\n\r\nHowever, once Code has loaded, I can then do Ctrl-` to open a Terminal window, and it works as expected (also every time).  Note that this is doing Remote development (so the Terminal is opening a session on my remote machine).\r\n\r\nI suspect the issue is that Code is trying to start the Terminal before $workspaceFolder is set, but it is set later, when I manually open the Terminal.

up from https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/commit/a62c6ee148f724e64b280359040c6c274bec150d where I added a new method to `IExtensionHostDebugService`: `openExtensionDevelopmentHostWindow`. The idea is that this method is to be removed from the renderer facing side of `IWindowsService`. \r\n\r\nI moved @weinand 's code from `web.simpleservices.ts` into the browser variant of `IExtensionHostDebugService`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/a62c6ee148f724e64b280359040c6c274bec150d/src/vs/workbench/contrib/debug/browser/extensionHostDebugService.ts#L51\r\n\r\nThe missing piece is to make this nice on the `electron-browser` side of things. That implementation is still talking through the `IWindowsService` to the `electron-main` side. Ideally this goes through a debug specific channel (maybe one exists already?).\r\n\r\n**Code pointers:**\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/a62c6ee148f724e64b280359040c6c274bec150d/src/vs/workbench/contrib/debug/electron-browser/extensionHostDebugService.ts#L25\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/a62c6ee148f724e64b280359040c6c274bec150d/src/vs/platform/debug/common/extensionHostDebugIpc.ts#L108\r\n\r\nIt looks like the launch service in electron-main is also using the method to open an extension development window, so we need to figure that out as well. However I am fine having an extension debug related service also in `electron-main`.
