new tasks APIs (fetchTask(), executeTask(), task events...) makes it more convenient to use vscode's own task system to spawn child process (as opposed to using something like `child_process`, for example). Still, AFAICT, there are two bits missing in the API:\r\n\r\n1. A method to get the underlying `Terminal` instance of a running task (maybe through `TaskExecution`?);\r\n\r\n2. Events that would be fired whenever something is written in the process' stdout/stderr (that would probably go in the `Terminal` instance itself)\r\n\r\nThis would be very useful to implement UI feedback (i.e progess notifications) while using vscode's task system. Right now, the only way I see to do that is to spawn my own proces, create an output channel and handle problem matching myself...\r\n\r\nDoes that make

Reproduce:\r\n\r\n*This is how I discovered the issue, but it's not specific to `runtimeVersion`.  I'm not sure if variable expansion is something that can happen, but if it could, outputting `env \"PATH=/path/to/node/version:${PATH}\"` would seemingly be a workaround.*\r\n\r\n*Apologies if this is a dupe; I searched but nothing was jumping out at me.*\r\n\r\n1. Set `PATH` to something approaching 1024 characters.  One way to do this, evidently, is to use zsh & antigen with a bunch of plugins.  :smile: [Example of large `PATH` here](https://gist.github.com/boneskull/b7f99a0c51a3254d28a882b17d6289c4); you could also just add a bunch of nonsense via something like\r\n    ```json\r\n    \"env\": {\r\n      \"FOO\": \"<insert 1024 random characters here>\"\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n1. Launch VS Code\r\n1. Add a launch config containing `runtimeVersion`, such as:\r\n    ```json\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"node\",\r\n      \"request\": \"launch\",\r\n      \"name\": \"node-red\",\r\n      \"runtimeExecutable\": \"node\",\r\n      \"runtimeVersion\": \"8.1.2\",\r\n      \"program\": \"app.js\",\r\n      \"console\": \"integratedTerminal\",\r\n      \"internalConsoleOptions\": \"neverOpen\"\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n1. Start debugging.  Terminal will show something like this: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/924465/45902355-0ec25f00-bd9b-11e8-95fb-5a95042911de.png)\r\n That's a limit of 1024 characters. You can ignore the `%`\r\n\r\n1. Once timeout is hit, you should see this alert: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/924465/45902279-dd499380-bd9a-11e8-9e46-1a99c26f5508.png)\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/59134","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/59134/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/59134/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/59134/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/59134","id":362749500,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNjI3NDk1MDA=","number":59134,"title":"Git:

a workspace in `/mnt/a/b/c/worspace.code-workspace`. Add a git repository to it with active changes. Open the workspace using the File menu and all decorations will be displayed correctly. Close the workspace before exiting vscode. Now create a symbolic link `/home/x/` to `/mnt/a` and open the workspace using the File menu and `/home/x/b/c/worspace.code-workspace`. The Source Control menu will still show all changes, but the explorer will no longer display the decorations. This error does not occur when opening the workspace via the console.\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/59090","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/59090/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/59090/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/59090/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/59090","id":362535142,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNjI1MzUxNDI=","number":59090,"title":"Recent
