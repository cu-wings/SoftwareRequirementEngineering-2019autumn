highlight filter (I hope I correctly name this feature) is awesome feature that I have been waiting for! Thank you! ðŸ™Œ \r\n\r\nCurrently it navigates user across all visible folders/files that has fuzzy match.\r\nIn case when I want to find some folder inside of long `node_modules` I will be still navigated through all visible filse/folders.\r\n\r\nSo if I'm typing `lo` inside of `node_modules` (when folder inside of `node_modules` highlighted) I will still have match on `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, and `src/locales`.\r\n\r\nWould be nice to have ability to limit match only inside parent folder(node).\r\nSo when I have `axios` folder selected inside `node_modules` and type `lo` - it will only highglight `babel-loader`, `lodash`, and `loglevel` package folders, but **not** `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, and `src/locales`.\r\n\r\nIt might be added to List filter widget, same

On Windows (there is no issue on Mac), launch the app using VS Code and check the `process.argv` array.  The fourth parameter is \"test://update?v=2\", which is incorrect.  There is no fifth parameter (but there should be, and the value should be \"arg2\").  Anything past the first ampersand character is cut off, even the second argument of \"arg2\".\r\n\r\nI've tried to use:\r\n\r\n- \"test://update?v=2^&id=4^&param=16\",\r\n- \"\\\\\"test://update?v=2&id=4&param=16\\\\\"\",\r\n- \"\\\\\"test://update?v=2^&id=4^&param=16\\\\\"\",\r\n\r\nbut I'm unable to get anything to work.

It's utterly hard to distinguish the editor having focus from other panels in VS code.\r\n\r\nIt's always an annoying matter of Try And Error when switching between other software and VS Code (using

left or the right one.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure y'all won't even recognize the right tab having a vertical squiggly line on the right.\r\n\r\nSo, I'd like to propose to highlight the editor having focus

Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Implement language server and publish diagnostic with zero length at the end of a line\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n        \"range\": {\r\n          \"start\": {\r\n            \"line\": 8,\r\n            \"character\": 11\r\n          },\r\n          \"end\": {\r\n            \"line\": 8,\r\n            \"character\": 11\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n        \"message\": \"max value\"\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n- The red squiggle renders over the last identifier on the line, which can be multiple characters. On every keystroke, the language server is publshing a new diagnostic where `character` is the last column of that line (== int max value).\r\n![2019-01-14 14 56 28](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1408093/51117043-ed372880-180c-11e9-9069-b8a3caa7d63a.gif)\r\n\r\n- I ideally expect the diagnostic to render as a single character as below (there is no space at end of the line). Alternatively, I would expect the zero-length diagnostic to render at most overÂ one character at the end of the line and not the full identifier.\r\n![screenshot 2019-01-14 at 14 48 01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1408093/51117102-15268c00-180d-11e9-8854-94f9ab377c16.png)\r\n\r\nPossibly related comment https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24711#issuecomment-304665290\r\n\r\n> Errors and Warnings now get artificially inflated such that they are visible even in the collapsed case.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes, I can reproduce with latest Insider but I had to install one extension for my language server to publish diagnostics https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=scalameta.metals"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/66468","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/66468/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/66468/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/66468/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/66468","id":398784658,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzOTg3ODQ2NTg=","number":66468,"title":"Shrink empty lines","user":{"login":"realbizkit","id":25567148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTY3MTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/25567148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/realbizkit","html_url":"https://github.com/realbizkit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/realbizkit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/realbizkit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/realbizkit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/realbizkit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/realbizkit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/realbizkit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/realbizkit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/realbizkit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/realbizkit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":756920294,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NTY5MjAyOTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-rendering","name":"editor-rendering","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":272689392,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODkzOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"dcdcdc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDc4OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDc4OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2019-01-14T08:16:12Z","updated_at":"2019-01-14T17:25:24Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Visual Studio has a nice extension called \"**Shrink Empty Lines**\" which enables the user to have empty lines and/or lines without alphanumeric characters shrunk in the editor to a specific extent.

Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\n![2019-01-13_14-14-06](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11512/51084626-1fc62000-173e-11e9-90ae-de800aa1efd6.png)\r\n\r\nOutput panel contains a valid path:\r\n```\r\n/Users/aleksi/Code/My/vscode-bug-multiroot/project-2/project2.go\r\n```\r\nWhen âŒ˜+clicked, it tries to use an invalid path:\r\n```\r\nfile:///Users/aleksi/Code/My/vscode-bug-multiroot/project/-2/project2.go\r\n```\r\nNote the extra `/` before `-2`. That seems to happen only with multi-root workspace when one root path is a prefix of another root path.\r\n\r\nExample repo: https://github.com/AlekSi/vscode-bug-multiroot\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. `git clone https://github.com/AlekSi/vscode-bug-multiroot.git`\r\n2. `code vscode-bug-multiroot/bug.code-workspace`\r\n3. Install Go plugin (but that issue is not specific for it).\r\n4. Open project2_test.go, click CodeLens' \"run test\".\r\n5. `go test` runs `go vet` and notices a bug in project2.go. âŒ˜+click on the file path in the Output panel.\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.30.2 (61122f88f0bf01e2ac16bdb9e1bc4571755f5bd8, 2019-01-07T22:48:31.260Z)\r\nOS version: Darwin x64 18.2.0"}]
