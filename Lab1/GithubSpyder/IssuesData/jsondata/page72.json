Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nExpanding emmet abbreviations inside inline functions is not working. Given the example React component below I am unable to expand any abbreviations inside the render function. Expanding works in rest of the file. \r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\nimport { Form } from 'react-final-form';\r\n\r\nconst SomeComponent = () => (\r\n  <Form render={() => (\r\n    <pre>Expanding Emmet abbreviations inside this function is not working</pre>\r\n  )}\r\n  />\r\n);\r\n\r\nexport default SomeComponent;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat bothers me the most is that it is not even working when explicitly selecting from the menu \"Emmet: Expand Abbreviation\". If it was up to me I would make the explicit choice from the menu expand whatever and in whatever syntax. Additionally would like to note that \"Emmet: Wrap with Abbreviation\" seems to already work like that. Shouldn't the \"Emmet: Expand Abbreviation\" work the same way?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.28.2 (7f3ce96ff4729c91352ae6def877e59c561f4850, 2018-10-17T00:18:43.347Z)\r\nOS version:

registered for the same scheme.\r\n\r\nWe have to dispose of the file system provider and register a new one because we want to change read-only status of the provider. The only way to do that is to do dispose-re-register for the same scheme.\r\n\r\nIdeally, if VSCode allowed to change read-only status of the provider on the fly, without the need for disposing-re-registering, this should help us avoid the issue.\r\n\r\nOr, alternatively, If VSCode cannot load the document because the file system provider got disposed in the middle of reading, VSCode should not try to load the document anymore and should close its editor window.\r\n\r\nWhen this issue happens I see a `TypeError` exception is thrown:\r\n```\r\nTypeError: Cannot read property

The big issue though is that if you go into a multi-line literal, and then try to type the closing backtick, vscode inserts two backticks, leaving you with three.\r\n\r\nFor example if I type:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst Button = styled.button`\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would expect to have the closing tick automatically inserted and the cursor in between them. Instead it just stops there. If I then go on to enter some css and then manually enter the closing backtick, I get:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst Button = styled.button`\r\n  background: papayawhip;\r\n  color: green;\r\n``\r\n```\r\n\r\nI then have to manually delete the third backtick, as if I delete the second, the whole pair is deleted because of the auto-close rules.\r\n\r\nI have verified this is happening on Mac and Windows 10, with extensions enabled and disabled, and in the Insiders build.\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.28.1 (3368db6750222d319c851f6d90eb619d886e08f5, 2018-10-11T18:07:48.477Z)\r\nOS version: Darwin x64

and generalized from https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/2605</sup>\r\n\r\nIt would be great if Visual Studio Code also supported a Unix configuration where PowerShell (Core) is configured as the user's default shell.\r\n\r\nBelow is an example of where that currently fails: when using an _external_ terminal (as controlled by setting `console\": \"externalTerminal`) for debugging, the debugger-invocation command line assumes a POSIX-like shell on Unix, and submits a command using the latter's syntax, which breaks in PowerShell.\r\n\r\nThere may be other, related cases.\r\n\r\nIn the debugger-invocation case, only a trivial tweak is required to support PowerShell too (see below).\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n* On a Unix-like platform with PowerShell Core installed, make the latter your default shell as follows: `chsh -s /usr/local/bin/pwsh` (macOS) or `chsh -s /usr/bin/pwsh` (Linux).\r\n\r\n* On Linux, reboot to make the new default shell take effect (not necessary on macOS).\r\n\r\n* Open any C# project in VS Code and debug with a `\".NET Core Launch (console)\"` configuration with setting `\"console\": \"externalTerminal\"`\r\n\r\n## Desired  behavior\r\n\r\nDebugger invocation should succeed.\r\n\r\n## Current behavior\r\n\r\nDebugger invocation fails, because the command line sent to the terminal assumes POSIX-like-shell syntax (e.g., `bash`), which PowerShell doesn't support.\r\n\r\nSample symptom:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS /Users/jdoe> cd '/Users/jdoe/.vscode/extensions/ms-vscode.csharp-1.16.2/.debugger/';
