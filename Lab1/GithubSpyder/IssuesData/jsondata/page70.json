Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nI'm using the search panel to search for text across an entire workspace. I have case sensitivty and whole word matching enabled. When I move selection through the results in the panel it opens the file containing the result for previewing. Because this selects the text of the current match, editor.selectionHighlight kicks in and highlights all the occurrances of the same text in the file. This doesn't respect the case sensitivity and whole word settings and ends up adding a ton of visual noise within the newly opened editor.\r\n\r\nI'm reasonably certain this has not always happened and is a bug introduced recently. Also, this behavior does not match what happens when searching within a single editor, where spurious highlighting never occurs.\r\n\r\nIdeally, selectionHighlight is disabled while the search panel is open. Or at the very least respects search settings so it isn't destroying the user's ability to see actual search results.\r\n\r\nExpected (selectionHighlight disabled):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/484784/47630179-9a4ab080-dafc-11e8-9a3a-defeb244416a.png)\r\n\r\nActual (selectionHighlight
