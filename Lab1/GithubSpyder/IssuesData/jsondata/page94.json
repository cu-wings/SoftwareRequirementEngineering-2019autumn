Consider this piece of code:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst files = await workspace.findFiles('**/*.md'); // https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/47645\r\n// TODO: Figure out https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/48674\r\nconsole.log(workspace.getConfiguration('search.exclude'));\r\nfor (const file of files) {\r\n    console.log(file.fsPath);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAbove, `workspace.getConfiguration('search.exclude')` returns:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"**/node_modules\": true,\r\n    \"**/bower_components\": true\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is merged from the default settings, I never change this configuration section.\r\n\r\nDespite that, the `workspace.findFiles('**/*.md')` (with or without `undefined` explicitly passed as a 2nd argument, shouldn't make a difference unless some weird parameter counting is going on) returns MarkDown files from my `node_modules` directory.\r\n\r\nI do not know how to run extension debugging in a \"none but this extension\" mode, but I installed a published version of my extension and tried installing it alone in my Insiders instance and was able to reproduce the problem.\r\n\r\nI am using VS Code 1.22.2 and VS Code Insiders 1.23.0-insider`.\r\n\r\nIs there anything else I can do to debug this

been using a cloud service provider for remote work.  In their service they provide Atom as a text editor, but I've been using Code for about a year now and am loathe to switch over my development environment.\r\n\r\nThey've bumped on something in the licensing.  They cannot:\r\n> share, publish, or lend the software, or provide it as a hosted solution for others to use, or transfer the software or this agreement to any third party.\r\n\r\nAfter looking around at all the confusion over Code's license I can understand the reasons Microsoft has the dual licensing system.  (I don't agree, but I understand.)  I even built a copy of Code from source to see if that would be usable (verdict is still out there).  But simpler would be for Microsoft to strike this line from the software license.  Leave in the non-transferable bit and cut out the rest. This would allow cloud services to provide Code as the de-facto editor, which can only benefit you in the long run by increasing user count and brand awareness.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, I'm not sure why this is even in here.  In my opinion it fundamentally goes against the branding that Microsoft has given code, which is that it's free for everyone and usable everywhere.  It feels like a hangover from the commercial version of the VS IDE, or from Windows itself, some boilerplate that gets tacked on automatically.\r\n\r\nThe alternative is to have people build Code from source, which removes all MS branding and telemetry. I'd think this less desirable for you.\r\n\r\nMy other thought is that they could provide a pop-up that offers to install it for the user, something akin to how Code is now being distributed with Anaconda.  Anaconda's use of the official installer seems to bypass this clause in the license.  However, this is very much *not* the solution I want, because the last thing the world needs are more pop-ups. :)\r\n\r\nThanks for

It would be helpful if it stopped just left of the scrollbar. Here is my rationale:\r\n- The line position isn't the same as the scrollbar position, except by coincidence. They are independent, however the highlighting suggests a linkage of some kind.\r\n- With certain color schemes it can be confusing at a quick glance to determine where on the scrollbar I actually am.\r\n\r\nExample of intrusion of line highlight into the scrollbar:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5439104/38955070-60bf0aaa-4308-11e8-9603-9d0620c13bcf.png)\r\n\r\nNotice how similar the two highlighted areas look on the scrollbar? On closer inspection I can tell that I am actually at the lower point on the scrollbar, because of the brown horizontal line. \r\n\r\nAs a workaround, I could easily change the color of the highlight to prevent confusion. But, I'm having trouble understanding why the highlight extends into the scrollbar in the first place. \r\n\r\nThanks for your consideration! \r\n\r\nVS Code 1.22.1

Feature request for keybindings\r\n\r\n### How works now\r\nvscode only supports `two` layers of keybindings combination:\r\n```json\r\n{ \"key\": \"ctrl+k ctrl+s\", \"command\": \"...\" }\r\n```\r\nHere you have `ctrl+k` as root and `ctrl+s` as specification.\r\n\r\n### Feature request\r\nI would like to have the ability of add `many` individual keys strokes in order to trigger a command:\r\n```\r\n{ \"key\": \"ctrl+space g a c\", \"command\": \"...\" }\r\n```\r\nHere the root is `ctrl+space`, followed by `g`, then `a` then `c` key\r\n\r\n### Implications\r\nThis may lead to a conflict where you have partial key bindings repeated:\r\n```json\r\n{ \"key\": \"ctrl+space g\", \"command\": \"...\" }\r\n{ \"key\": \"ctrl+space g a\", \"command\": \"...\" }\r\n```\r\nThe way of resolve this is adding a small delay before resolve the keystroke in order to make sure that finished the command.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why\r\nI consider this very helpful in order to add `Mnemonics` keybindings, usually I bind git commands in this way: **g**it **a**dd . & git **c**ommit, So the command becomes the follow keybind: `ctrl+space g a c` (git add and commit).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nLet me

sorting lines using `editor.action.sortLinesAscending` (\"Sort Lines Ascending\" via the Command Palette) the lines are sorted in a very strange order when the comparison involves a symbol character.\r\n\r\nI would expect that `.` (period) would be sorted before `_` (underscore) because in ASCII, period is 46 and underscore is 95.\r\n\r\nHowever, vscode uses `localeCompare` as its sorting method (see [sortLinesCommand.ts:76]( https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/54e7055c12f4e9a80f44c67758a12cf248d5f374/src/vs/editor/contrib/linesOperations/sortLinesCommand.ts#L76)), which results in underscore being sorted before period. See the repro steps below for an example.\r\n\r\nI saw a previous issue regarding this (#15516) but it was closed because the ASCII ordering was in fact correct. In the case I've outlined below, the ordering is not correct.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the correct solution would be but I think that for ASCII symbols, ASCII ordering should be obeyed. I do realise that \"Sort Lines Ascending\" is an ambiguous term - ascending according to what criteria? - so perhaps the command could be renamed to something more specific, or you could provide different default sorting options.\r\n\r\n<!-- Use Help > Report Issue to prefill these. -->\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.22.1 Commit 950b8b0d37a\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10 Enterprise Version 1709 OS Build 16299.371\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
