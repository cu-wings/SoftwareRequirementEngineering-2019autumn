is a fix for #62003.\r\nThis fixes a UX problem that's easy to observe when using a trackpad, particularly on a MacBook:\r\nIt's almost impossible to scroll purely vertically, so on files with long lines a horizontal drift can occur which means the first few character columns might drift under the gutter even when the scroll intent was purely vertical.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a boolean to the editor configuration (`editor.scrollPredominantAxisOnly`). When enabled it scrolls only the predominant axis. This prevents unintentional scroll drift, i.e. slightly diagonal scrolling when scrolling only one axis was intended.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I propose this to be the new default since for almost all software that presents text (or code) this is the standard behavior. The current behavior is standard only in graphic-centric applications where moving diagonally is intended more often.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/70033","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/70033/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/70033/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/70033/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/70033","id":418702730,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MTg3MDI3MzA=","number":70033,"title":"VoiceOver
