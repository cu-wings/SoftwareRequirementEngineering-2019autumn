some languages, there may be multiple single-line comment markers, like `//` and `///`. However the language configs can only provide a single lineComment setting which is used by the `Remove Line Comment` command. This makes it hard to uncomment. For example, take this C# code:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\n/// <summary>\r\n/// The GetZero method.\r\n/// </summary>\r\n/// <example> \r\n/// This sample shows how to call the <see cref=\"GetZero\"/> method.\r\n/// <code>\r\n/// class TestClass \r\n/// {\r\n///     static int Main() \r\n///     {\r\n///         return GetZero();\r\n///     }\r\n/// }\r\n/// </code>\r\n/// </example>\r\npublic static int GetZero()\r\n{\r\n\treturn 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you copy/pasted the code from the `<example>` section and tried to remove the comment using `Remove Line Comment` you end up with this:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\n/ class TestClass \r\n/ {\r\n/     static int Main() \r\n/     {\r\n/         return GetZero();\r\n/     }\r\n/ }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe have a similar issue in Dart - we use both `//` and `///`. There are things like [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/spec/triple_slash_comments_spec.html) that encourage triple-slashes too.\r\n\r\nAlthough `Add Line Comment` would only be able to use the first, it'd be nice if in the language declaration we could provide multiple `lineComments` so that removing could handle this case better (it can use the longest comment first when trying to remove the markers):\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n\"comments\": {\r\n\t\"lineComment\": [ \"//\", \"///\" ],\r\n\t\"blockComment\": [ \"/*\", \"*/\" ]\r\n},\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n\"comments\": {\r\n\t\"lineComment\": \"//\",\r\n\t\"additionalLineComments\": [ \"///\" ],\r\n\t\"blockComment\": [ \"/*\", \"*/\" ]\r\n},\r\n}\r\n```"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/64657","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/64657/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/64657/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/64657/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/64657","id":388890891,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzODg4OTA4OTE=","number":64657,"title":"Way to Re-enter Context of the Placeholder Tab Progression While Using Snippets","user":{"login":"joejoe04","id":45705494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NzA1NDk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/45705494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joejoe04","html_url":"https://github.com/joejoe04","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joejoe04/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joejoe04/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joejoe04/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joejoe04/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joejoe04/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joejoe04/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joejoe04/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joejoe04/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joejoe04/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODkzOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"dcdcdc","default":false},{"id":403204290,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MDMyMDQyOTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/snippets","name":"snippets","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTQwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTQwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2018-12-08T06:15:14Z","updated_at":"2018-12-10T08:31:31Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"When going through tab progression of a long snippet with many different placeholder values to enter, it can be possible to accidentally click a mouse or hit a wrong key that exits from the snippet context altogether.

The TS team has worked to significantly improve and shorten diagnostic messages, including replacing complex type information with `...`, however there are still cases where you need to see the full type information. Right now, we have to staticly choose to expand the additional information or not. They would like the user to be able to interactively expand types within a diagnostic\r\n\r\nIn addition, the overall diagnostic experience could be improved. Two areas identified talking with the TS team:\r\n\r\n* Syntax coloring of inline code in diagnostics\r\n* Go to definition in diagnostics\r\n\r\n## Refs\r\n#11847\r\n\r\n## Desired User Experience\r\nConsider a diagnostic message  `T<...>`. We would like the `...` to be something like a  link. Clicking it would expand the diagnostic message to `T<Array<...>>`, which itself contains another expandable link\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nThe main focus is on being able dynamically to expand sections of a diagnostic. We need new VS Code API support for this and then will need languages to adopt this API. However, I think the other two features should be considered while designing the new diagnostics API as they are likely something we would like to support and will influence overall api design \r\n\r\nFor expansion, we want to be able to:\r\n\r\n- Mark arbitrary spans within a diagnostics as expandable\r\n- Lazily compute these expansions, i.e. don't resolve the expansions ahead of time\r\n- Allow expansions to contain other expansions\r\n- Show a progress indicator of some kind while an expansion is being resolved\r\n\r\nMany of these features also make sense for quick info hovers\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/64533","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/64533/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/64533/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/64533/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/64533","id":388214640,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzODgyMTQ2NDA=","number":64533,"title":"F4

In fact, Atom has already changed to [tree-sitter syntax](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-rust) as the bundled Rust language grammar support package (https://github.com/atom/atom/tree/master/packages/language-rust-bundled).\r\n\r\nHowever, Vscode's bundled rust support extension is based on Zargony's [package](https://github.com/zargony/atom-language-rust) which is not updated for nearly a year and many issues open with no reply at all.\r\n\r\nCurrently every highlighting problem in https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/49932 still happens and that's not simply a \"theme\" thing as @mjbvz mentioned in the orignal issue, I think.\r\n\r\nIn the original issue, @mjbvz  also declares that \r\n> Since we use the same grammar, I believe this is just a matter of theming.
