VSCode Version: 1.30.2\r\n- OS Version: macOS 10.14.3\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create an extension that [registers a text document content provider](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#2290) for a custom scheme, say `custom`.  Implement the provider to return a json object as text.\r\n2. Declare a jsonValidation in package.json with a `fileMatch` of `custom://*.todo`.\r\n3. [Open](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#2246) a text document for a uri under that custom scheme with path ending in something.todo, and also a defined query or fragment [1], then [set text document language](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#2319) to 'json', and [show it](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#2074).\r\n4.

check. -->\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes\r\n\r\nDebugger is ignoring `skipFiles` with 1.30.1 and behaving erratically with 1.31.0-insider.\r\nConsider the following situation:\r\n![fig-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15155315/51667804-0f753700-1fc1-11e9-8c91-27e4c29c6bcf.png)\r\n\r\nGiven what is witten in [Skipping uninteresting code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging#_skipping-uninteresting-code-node-chrome),\r\n> If you step into a skipped file, you won't stop there - you will stop on the next executed line that is not in a skipped file.\r\n\r\nI assume that being the debugger stopped at line `35`, either pressing `Step Over` or `Step Into` I'd immediately stop at line `37`.\r\nHere's instead what happens.\r\n\r\n## 1.30.1\r\n\r\n- `Step Over`, debugger stops at line `37`\r\n- `Step Into`, debugger ignores `skipFiles` and stops into `${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/lunr/lunr.js`\r\n\r\n![fig-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15155315/51667958-6713a280-1fc1-11e9-9312-14b893a6087d.png)\r\n\r\nYou can see in the call stack that `lunr.js` is grayed, ie considered skipped, but nonetheless debugger stops in it.\r\n\r\n## 1.31.0-insider\r\n\r\n- `Step Over`, debugger stops at line `37`\r\n- `Step Into`, the stop indicator in the gutter and the line highlight turn greenish and debugger stays stopped there.\r\n\r\n![fig-3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15155315/51668079-b8239680-1fc1-11e9-8c4d-89e95db5fbf9.png)\r\n\r\nFrom this moment on, any further press of either `Step Over` or `Step Into` or `Step Out` is ignored and the debugger is stuck there.\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/67026","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/67026/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/67026/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/67026/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/67026","id":402468964,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MDI0Njg5NjQ=","number":67026,"title":"postDebugTask

attempting to debug a node program written in TypeScript running in a Docker container. I'm pretty much following the [Docker-TypeScript VSCode recipe](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-recipes/tree/master/Docker-TypeScript).\r\n\r\nMy problem is that when I debug, the `postDebugTask` is running before the debug session gets underway. If I remove the `postDebugTask`, I notice that the blue bar at the bottom of the VSCode window turns orange, briefly turns blue again, then turns orange again (and remains orange until I stop the program).\r\n\r\nThis leads me to believe that when the `postDebugTask` is in force, the brief debugger outage triggers the `postDebugTask`, causing the debug process to fail (since teardown is occurring before any real debugging can begin).\r\n\r\n# Related Issues\r\n\r\nThis is closely related to if not identical to #43516, but that issue has been closed for a while, and I am locked out from commenting.\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.30.2\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10.0.17763\r\n\r\n# Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

support for filtering in Explorer by typing parts of a file or folder name was added (#66497). There are two modes:\r\n\r\nThe default mode simply highlights all matches in currently expanded folders and scrolls to the first found match. Works perfectly, nicely engineered.\r\n\r\nBy activating the \"Filter on Type\" mode, the tree gets pruned to only those elements that match the filter. However, this pruning currently removes all folders which had not been expanded at least once before-hand, no matter if they contain a match or not.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the behavior of the Filter on Type mode is counterintuitive as the results shouldn't depend on how the developer has interacted with the tree in advance. At least then there should be some indication on which folders were not considered in the search. In my case, I commonly want to filter on specific file types, and since there is no \"Expand All\" feature in the Explorer, the current work-around would be to manually expand all folders upfront and then use the new filter feature so that I can be sure that no entries are missing.\r\n\r\nI'm assuming this is related to the fact that folder nodes are lazily resolved since they might be remote resources. On the other hand, the normal search functionality seems to have no problem with these scenarios, probably because the expectation is that it's OK to wait a bit until you get the results, whereas here you more or less want it immediately. Maybe a hybrid would be a good solution: do the quick filtering as it is and display that immediately, and in the background start a regular filename search backed by (still experimental) [search provider API](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_24#_search-provider-api). Then merge these when the results come in.\r\n\r\n@isidorn

would be nice to have option to disable fuzzy match on folders/files.\r\nUse case:\r\nI'm looking for Webpack loaders inside `node_modules`. If I type `load` or even `loade` I will have a lot of matchings like `global-modules-path`, `load-json-file`, `lodash.clonedeep` and several files inside opened `src` and `test` folders.\r\nIn particular case I can search for `loader` ant it will still match `babel-plugin-transform-es2015-shorthand-properties`, `src/utils/check-local-folder.ts` etc.\r\n\r\nAbility to disable fuzzy much for similar cases will drastically reduce number of matches that are not relevant.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in #66912 it might be added to added to List filter widget, same panel as \"Filter on type\" toggle."}]
