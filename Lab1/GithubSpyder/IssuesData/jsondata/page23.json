common workflow for me when a \"find\" operation in the current file doesn't turn up any results is to then search for the same term across all files.\r\nThis is trivial in VSPro, where hitting [Ctrl]-[Shift]-[F] at this point brings up \"Find in files\" with the same search terms as the \"Find\" dialog.\r\n\r\nVSCode has an unfortunate behavior here that I thought was a bug for a long time.\r\nWhen pressing [Ctrl]-[Shift]-[F] after a failed local find, the \"Find in files\" input is seeded with a truncated version of the search terms.\r\nWhat's actually happening is that \"Find in files\" is being seeded not with the current \"find\" query, but with the selected text from the current document, which, since the find failed, represents only the longest matching prefix of the actual search terms.\r\n\r\nWhile seeding \"find in files\" from the current document selection is desirable when focus is in the document, it would be much more useful, when focus is in the \"find\" popup, to seed \"find in files\" from the full search terms there instead.\r\n\r\nThanks for a great

VSCode Version: Issue is the same in Stable, Insiders and Exploration\r\n- OS Version: macOS\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open project which consists a file with a long single line\r\n2. Type word in search view and press search\r\n3. You will see Search View is freeze and VS Code is stuck and you can't do anything\r\n\r\nBefore rendering items in Search View it freezes and after search is done when you scroll through items it freezes. Something is really wrong if file with one single long line exist in the project.\r\n\r\nHere is video of showing how the problem looks like:\r\n\r\n**Search View freezes after search while scrolling through items**\r\nhttps://streamable.com/uv8wl\r\n\r\n**Search View freezes before search**\r\nhttps://streamable.com/ugktu\r\n\r\nHere is the files to reproduce it by using \"Steps to Reproduce\" mentioned above.

And with real project it's 10x times worst._\r\n\r\nI did similar test in the Atom, Sublime Text and WebStorm. All handles this problem properly and works as expected.\r\n\r\n_For me it looks like the search itself works fine, but Search View can't handle to render items with very long lines._\r\n\r\n/cc

I find it very helpful when working with TypeScript ASTs:\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hediet/vscode-debug-visualizer/master/docs/demo.gif)\r\n\r\nTo do that, I had to fork node-debug2 and [send the `paused` event as custom event together with the current frame id](https://github.com/hediet/vscode-node-debug2/commit/a2a43db0b5926d81d02136482031f4229537d7bd#diff-d03a74f75ec189cbc7dd3d2e105fc9c9R998).\r\nWithout manually patching the node debug adapter, the extension could neither visualize local variables as it doesn't know the current frame id nor could it update the visualization when the next breakpoint is hit as there is no event for that that can be consumed by extensions.\r\nI used the [`evaluation` request](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/42989) to evaluate the given expression.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if VS Code could provide an event `onExecutionStateChanged` with a signature similar to this:\r\n```ts\r\nvscode.debug.onExecutionStateChanged: Event<DebugSessionExecutionStateChangedEvent>;\r\n\r\ntype DebugSessionExecutionStateChangedEvent = {\r\n   newState: \"running\" | \"stopped\";\r\n} | {\r\n   newState: \"paused\"\r\n   newFrameId: number;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSuch an event would enable extensions like mine that could highly improve the debugging

a (Typescript) React project it is common to have both `.ts` files and `.tsx` files all result in `.js` files in the end. It is possible to exclude some of these, but to my search it did not seem possible to hide both these types of files. It would be nice to be able to hide derived resources (JS files in this case) based on more sophisticated expressions. \r\n\r\nOne solution would be to allow multiple patterns. It might look something like:\r\n\r\n    \"files.exclude\": {\r\n        \"**/*.js\": {\r\n            \"when\": [ \"$(basename).ts\", \"$(basename).tsx\" ]\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n\r\nAnother way

Observe you are no longer able to scroll up to view the console history.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior: Console \"top\" is not reset and all output can be viewed\r\nActual behavior: Console history is lost.\r\n\r\nThis used to work correctly several versions ago and console history was preserved when the console was toggled. I use this by keeping my build watchers running in a small window at the bottom while I code and a hotkey to toggle the console maximize when I need to see the results of the watchers. Normally, I only need to see 3-4 lines when the watchers succeed, then when there's an error, I can toggle the maximize and scroll back to see the results. With this bug, my workflow is hindered greatly as I have to keep a separate console open and alt-tab over and over to see the results.\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.36.1 (2213894ea0415ee8c85c5eea0d0ff81ecc191529, 2019-07-08T22:59:35.033Z)\r\nOS version: Windows_NT x64 10.0.18362\r\n![vscodeBug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12192719/62632609-9ba8d500-b8e7-11e9-94d7-a33926267a90.gif)\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>System Info</summary>\r\n\r\n|Item|Value|\r\n|---|---|\r\n|CPUs|Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7820X CPU @ 3.60GHz (16 x 3600)|\r\n|GPU Status|2d_canvas: enabled<br>flash_3d: enabled<br>flash_stage3d: enabled<br>flash_stage3d_baseline: enabled<br>gpu_compositing: enabled<br>multiple_raster_threads: enabled_on<br>native_gpu_memory_buffers: disabled_software<br>oop_rasterization: disabled_off<br>protected_video_decode: unavailable_off<br>rasterization: enabled<br>skia_deferred_display_list: disabled_off<br>skia_renderer: disabled_off<br>surface_synchronization: enabled_on<br>video_decode: enabled<br>viz_display_compositor: disabled_off<br>webgl: enabled<br>webgl2: enabled|\r\n|Load (avg)|undefined|\r\n|Memory (System)|63.73GB (41.13GB free)|\r\n|Process Argv|C:\\g\\PowerBIClients2\\src|\r\n|Screen Reader|no|\r\n|VM|0%|\r\n</details><details><summary>Extensions (3)</summary>\r\n\r\nExtension|Author (truncated)|Version\r\n---|---|---\r\nnumbered-bookmarks|ale|6.2.1\r\ngitlens|eam|9.9.3\r\npbi-vscode-tools|Mic|0.0.14\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n<!-- generated by issue reporter -->"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/78606","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/78606/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/78606/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/78606/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/78606","id":477771036,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0Nzc3NzEwMzY=","number":78606,"title":"Allow opening files/tabs in new windows opened through vscode.commands.executeCommand API","user":{"login":"jsondoo","id":21695878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjk1ODc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/21695878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsondoo","html_url":"https://github.com/jsondoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsondoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsondoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsondoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsondoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsondoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsondoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsondoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsondoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsondoo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":290465400,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTA0NjU0MDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/api","name":"api","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689392,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODkzOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"dcdcdc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2019-08-07T08:07:42Z","updated_at":"2019-08-08T09:02:11Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Currently you are able to open a file path in a new VSCode window with:\r\n```\r\nvscode.commands.executeCommand(\r\n  vscode.openFolder,\r\n  vscode.Uri.file(someFilePath),\r\n  true // true to open in new window, false to open in same window\r\n);\r\n```\r\nhttps://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/commands\r\n\r\nHowever, the API does not seem to support a way to open more files in the new window in any way.

is similar to https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/9285, but that seems to be about letting the end user configure the context menu, whereas I want to provide context menu commands from my extension, but dynamically (such that they can't be in the package manifest).\r\n\r\nI know we've previously discussed something similar to this around making context menus *async*, but that's not required here - the context menus can be provided up-front (and periodically updated), but they are based on launch configs and therefore can't be in package.json.\r\n\r\nHere's a screenshot fo a new feature I added to my extension:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2019-08-06 at 5 23 29 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1078012/62557457-ee927600-b86e-11e9-93ac-51d90680f946.png)\r\n\r\nThe \"Run\" and \"Debug\" code lens already existed - they're hard-coded. The other two are are user-defined - the user can configure additional launch configurations for launching tests. In `provideCodeLens` I read the launch configs, see if any are marked as templates, and include them in the result.\r\n\r\nI'd like to also add them to the context menu for the test tree here:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2019-08-06 at 5 41 28 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1078012/62558721-74afbc00-b871-11e9-952f-48dd1838dc5a.png)\r\n\r\nHowever AFAIC these need to be pre-declared in the package.json - and of course I don't know what custom configs the users will add. I'd like to instead supply these commands (like I do in `provideCodeLens`) for each node (either at node creation time, on-demand, or just at extension startup + whenever the user modifies the launch configs)."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/78571","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/78571/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/78571/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/78571/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/78571","id":477483237,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0Nzc0ODMyMzc=","number":78571,"title":"`\"editor.suggestSelection\": \"recentlyUsed\"` should be a little more sticky","user":{"login":"varkor","id":3943692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDM2OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3943692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/varkor","html_url":"https://github.com/varkor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varkor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varkor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varkor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varkor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varkor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varkor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varkor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varkor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varkor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129993,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTYxMjk5OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"8D6673","default":true},{"id":421907356,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MjE5MDczNTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/suggest","name":"suggest","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTQwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTQwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":17,"created_at":"2019-08-06T16:38:28Z","updated_at":"2019-08-27T10:33:23Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.36.1\r\n- OS Version: macOS 10.12.6\r\n\r\nConsider the file:\r\n```\r\ngame\r\ngamma\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.

for a setting ID will sometimes produce a single result, and other times multiple results. The issue appears to be that **search results while editing the search input are different from search results that come from fresh/cleared input**.\r\n\r\nThis issue is a bit trivial, since the results still yield the target settings. It's just that they aren't consistent results. The only reason why I noticed this myself is that I'm creating a VSCode course and I wanted to mention that exact matches could be achieved by searching for a setting ID. But then I noticed that this wasn't always the case.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\r\n\r\n1. Open the settings UI editor.\r\n2. Search for \"editor fontSize\" (noting the _multiple_ results).\r\n3. Back track with cursor (but do NOT delete).\r\n4. Add the dot, changing input to \"editor.fontSize\" (noting the _multiple_ results).\r\n5. Clear input with escape key.\r\n6. Search for \"editor.fontSize\" (note the _single_ result).\r\n\r\n**Environment:**\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.37.0-insider\r\n- OS Version: macOS 10.14.4\r\n- Occurs when all extensions are disabled?: Yes\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/78438","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/78438/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/78438/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/78438/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/78438","id":476488113,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NzY0ODgxMTM=","number":78438,"title":"vs
