Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nI don't believe this is new, but I think I have finally figured out an issue I've been having for a while now. The behavior I've been seeing is that using quick fixes to say add imports would sometimes completely screw up and insert imports in the middle of words, etc. I had always assumed that this was do to some timing conflict with applying the fix and my webpack watcher (which does linting fixes, including reordering imports), but until now I hadn't tracked down exactly how it happened.\r\n\r\nToday, I noticed that just showing the lightbulb quick fix menu (via shortcut key or using the mouse) causes the document to be saved -- this is because it is apparently considered to be a focus change as I have `\"files.autoSave\": \"onFocusChange\"` set. IMO this should not be considered a focus change.\r\n\r\nSo because of this, changing focus to the menu, saves the document, which kicks off the watcher, while I then execute one of the fixes, which ends up applying a change to the document which might be a moving target because the webpack watcher is also mucking with it.\r\n\r\nCan we change the quick fix menu to not be considered a focus change of the document?\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code - Insiders 1.33.0-insider (0ac111466ec925fd5ca180ab9893f51531e419b2, 2019-04-01T15:51:40.913Z)\r\nOS version: Windows_NT x64

This can be as subtle as adding single line comments, formatting the entire file or even changing statements or whole function bodies.\r\n\r\nThen however, the js to ts source map is not valid anymore.\r\nThis is especially problematic when adding a single empty line at the top of the file - you have to restart the debugee so that nodejs catches up the new sourcemap.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if VSCode could create a new source map from the old ts source file (if the old content is embedded in the source map) to the new content (= the current editors content) and combine it with the existing source map. Code that could not be matched could be grayed out (e.g. changed statements and so on).

all,\r\n\r\nIt would be very handy if I could take a line of debug console output and delete it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you have lots of `log` / `printf` statements throughout an application to track how an object is manipulated from point to point (e.g. tracking changes in a Redux store or something similar), it would be very nice to be able to delete log lines pertaining to certain actions, or to remove them until you have a clear picture of what's going on.\r\n\r\nMaybe it can be buried in a right click action on the line in question?\r\n\r\nOther thoughts?"}]
