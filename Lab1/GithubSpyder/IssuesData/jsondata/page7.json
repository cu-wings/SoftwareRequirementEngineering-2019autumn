October we groom our open issues.\r\n\r\n## Preparation\r\n- [ ] :runner: review [issue types](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Issue-Tracking#issue-types)\r\n- [ ] :runner: review [feature areas](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Feature-Areas)\r\n- [x] review [issue grooming](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Issue-Grooming)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Review Guidelines\r\n\r\nIn the first pass reviewing the issues has a higher priority than fixing issues. Clearly, we'll use common sense, i.e. we'll make easy fixes on the fly. During review please make sure:\r\n\r\n- to close obsolete/fixed issues and mark duplicates as appropriate,\r\n- that each issue has a [type](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Issue-Tracking#issue-types) \r\n- that each issue is assigned to a [feature area](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Feature-Areas)\r\n- that bugs that you plan to fix during October are assigned to the October milestone. Since the main focus is on housekeeping, be conservative.\r\n- to close out-of-scope feature requests assign the `*out-of-scope` label. Take into account that we'll have a \"polishing, take care of smaller issues\" milestone in early 2020. There is no value in keeping issues open that don't have any realistic chance of being addressed.\r\n- close bugs as \"won't fix\" if there is no cost-benefit balance. It's not that we don't care about users who are affected by an issue but, for example, if the fix is so involved that we risk regressions for many, fixing is not a reasonable choice.\r\n\r\nOtherwise the normal rules apply:\r\n- assign the `important` label to issues that\r\n  -  result in data loss\r\n  - a breakage of extension\r\n  - critical security, performance issues\r\n  - UI issue that makes a feature unusable\r\n- issues that the community can take up should be labeled as `help-wanted`\r\n- if issues are suitable for beginners you can also add the `good-first-issue` label and add code pointers that help beginners to get started with a PR\r\n- feature requests that should be implemented as extensions should be labeled `extensions-candidate` and be closed\r\n\r\n\r\n## Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease make sure that you also do this grooming in our satellite repositories.\r\n\r\n### Issues assigned to you\r\n- [ ] @aeschli \r\n- [ ] @alexandrudima\r\n- [ ] @bowdenk7\r\n- [ ]

to Definition and Find All Reference are not 100% reliable in VsCode. The problem occur with VsCode itself for the langages it handle and with extensions for the others langages. VsCode (or the extensions) sometimes doesn't find any definition, or sometimes they don't find all references. That happen because the way of finding the definition and references is based on a certain level of \"understanding\" of the code. So when the code do something that make it hard to find definition and references you end up with something broken. \r\n\r\nI don't have any exemple for a language that VsCode handle but that not hard to find. I have one with Prestashop 1.6.1 source code with the extension Intelephense. If you try to go to definition of $product->addCombinationEntity in controllers/admin/AdminImportController.php it doesn't find any definition and if you try to find all references of $product->addCombinationEntity it doesn't find anything. It fail besause the way that Prestashop name and load Class (https://github.com/bmewburn/vscode-intelephense/issues/700).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand Go to definition and Find all references work 100% of the time in Sublime text and a lot of developers would love to have something similar in VsCode. It seem that Sublime just make a text search to show definition and reference. It's very basic since it show you everything it find even in other langage (ex: js whereas you are in a php file...) but it find everything and it's very reliable. If we can have the same thing in VsCode maybe even better if you limit the search to relevant code (same langage) it will be awesome. Maybe as a workspace option to activate only on project that need it.\r\n\r\nText search is far from perfect but it's far far better than having nothing or, worse, missing references for example when you need to modify all of them. I think a lot of developers rely on Go to definition and Find all reference to quickly navigate through code. A lot of developers use Sublime and love it whereas it have only a very basic text search based Go to definition and Find all reference but that work 100% of the time. Again, an optional text search in complement will make VsCode on par with Sublime for these features, and even better if you manage to limit the result to relevant code, and will fulfill the need of a lot of developers.\r\n\r\nWe need these features to be 100% reliable to use them professionally so, in my opinion, it's almost mandatory to include an optional text search in Go to definition and Find all references. Thanks !\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/82021","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/82021/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/82021/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/82021/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/82021","id":503074747,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MDMwNzQ3NDc=","number":82021,"title":"Markdown image links with relative paths that navigate back - not displayed in Markdown Preview","user":{"login":"alexbarten","id":7818752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTg3NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7818752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbarten","html_url":"https://github.com/alexbarten","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbarten/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbarten/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbarten/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbarten/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbarten/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbarten/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbarten/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbarten/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbarten/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":299344519,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTkzNDQ1MTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/markdown","name":"markdown","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODIxOTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODIxOTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2019-10-06T09:22:42Z","updated_at":"2019-10-07T20:42:57Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.39.0-insider and 1.38.1-stable\r\n- The insider version has no extensions installed\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10 Pro 1903\r\n- Does this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes\r\n\r\nMarkdown image links with relative paths that navigate up **`(..\\)`** are not displayed in the Markdown Preview.

Create/copy an image in a different folder on the same level (adjacent) or higher in the folder hierarchy.  \r\nFor example: the .md in: C:\\Users\\you\\learning\\summaries \r\nand the image in C:\\Users\\you\\learning\\resources or n C:\\Users\\you\\learning\r\n3. Refer to the image from the Markdown: `![this image will not be displayed](..\\resources\\example.png)`\r\n\r\nHow did I test so far?\r\n\r\n1. I have tested with PNG and JPG files. No difference.\r\n2. I have used adjacent (= same level), child and parent folders. This is how I found out that child folders do not pose a problem, whereas parent and adjacent folders do. So when I use `..\\` in the path the problem occurs, else not.\r\n3. I have used forward and backward slashes in the path description. No difference.\r\n4. I have used escaped and non-escaped forward and backward slashes in the path.

found this command in the command palette, I tried typing \"hello\" and then using it, but it did nothing, because the cursor hasn't moved since the last edit.\r\nI had to google it to figure out what the command does.\r\n\r\n#### Reasoning:\r\n\r\nEven though the command also undo's selection changes and not just cursor movements, I think \"cursor\" is a general term the refers to both \"cursor\" and \"selection\".\r\n\r\nAlso, the command name itself is already \"cursorUndo\", it makes sense for the name in the command palette to use the same term.\r\n\r\nHaving \"cursor\" in the command's name will make it clear it undo's things that the cursor does, such as moving and selecting text.\r\nA user that will find this command in the command palette will most likely attempt to move the

calling http(s).request only with options the method and path are changed to wrong value.\r\n\r\nI've written simple example. \r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.38.1\r\n- OS Version: Ubuntu 19.04 and Windows 10 1903\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run this code.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst https = require('https');\r\nconst Url = require('url');\r\n\r\nconst applyUrlToOptions = (options, url) => {\r\n\r\n    options.host = url.host;\r\n    options.origin = url.origin;\r\n    options.searchParams = url.searchParams;\r\n    options.protocol = url.protocol;\r\n    options.hostname = url.hostname;\r\n    options.hash = url.hash;\r\n    options.search = url.search;\r\n    options.pathname = url.pathname;\r\n    options.path = `${url.pathname}${url.search || ''}`;\r\n    options.href = url.href;\r\n    if (url.port !== '') {\r\n        options.port = Number(url.port);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (url.username || url.password) {\r\n        options.auth = `${url.username}:${url.password}`;\r\n        options.username = url.username;\r\n        options.password = url.password;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return options;\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst testProxyResolver = (method, url, options) => {\r\n    const uri = {};\r\n    const parsedUri = new Url.URL(url);\r\n\r\n    applyUrlToOptions(uri, parsedUri);\r\n\r\n    uri.method = method.toUpperCase();\r\n    uri.headers = options.headers || {};\r\n    uri.headers.host = uri.host;\r\n    uri.headers['content-type'] = 'application/json';\r\n    uri.headers['content-length'] = options.payload.length;\r\n\r\n    return  https.request(uri);\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst data = testProxyResolver('POST', 'https://example.com', {payload: 'payload'});\r\n\r\ndata.agent = undefined; // to reduce output\r\n\r\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. In the console output will be the correct result of https.request\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"_events\": {},\r\n  \"_eventsCount\": 1,\r\n  \"output\": [],\r\n  \"outputEncodings\": [],\r\n  \"outputCallbacks\": [],\r\n  \"outputSize\": 0,\r\n  \"writable\": true,\r\n  \"_last\": true,\r\n  \"chunkedEncoding\": false,\r\n  \"shouldKeepAlive\": false,\r\n  \"useChunkedEncodingByDefault\": true,\r\n  \"sendDate\": false,\r\n  \"_removedConnection\": false,\r\n  \"_removedContLen\": false,\r\n  \"_removedTE\": false,\r\n  \"_contentLength\": null,\r\n  \"_hasBody\": true,\r\n  \"_trailer\": \"\",\r\n  \"finished\": false,\r\n  \"_headerSent\": false,\r\n  \"socket\": null,\r\n  \"connection\": null,\r\n  \"_header\": null,\r\n  \"method\": \"POST\",\r\n  \"path\": \"/\",\r\n  \"_ended\": false,\r\n  \"res\": null,\r\n  \"timeoutCb\": null,\r\n  \"upgradeOrConnect\": false,\r\n  \"parser\": null,\r\n  \"maxHeadersCount\": null\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Run the code above into vscode extension by the command from the palette \r\n4. The result will be wrong. Method and useChunkedEncodingByDefault properties are different.\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"_events\": {},\r\n  \"_eventsCount\": 1,\r\n  \"output\": [],\r\n  \"outputEncodings\": [],\r\n  \"outputCallbacks\": [],\r\n  \"outputSize\": 0,\r\n  \"writable\": true,\r\n  \"_last\": true,\r\n  \"chunkedEncoding\": false,\r\n  \"shouldKeepAlive\": false,\r\n  \"useChunkedEncodingByDefault\": false,\r\n  \"sendDate\": false,\r\n  \"_removedConnection\": false,\r\n  \"_removedContLen\": false,\r\n  \"_removedTE\": false,\r\n  \"_contentLength\": null,\r\n  \"_hasBody\": true,\r\n  \"_trailer\": \"\",\r\n  \"finished\": false,\r\n  \"_headerSent\": false,\r\n  \"socket\": null,\r\n  \"connection\": null,\r\n  \"_header\": null,\r\n  \"method\": \"GET\",\r\n  \"path\": \"/\",\r\n  \"_ended\": false,\r\n  \"res\": null,\r\n  \"timeoutCb\": null,\r\n  \"upgradeOrConnect\": false,\r\n  \"parser\": null,\r\n  \"maxHeadersCount\": null\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt seems like the error somewhere here:\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blame/d3eb24828e2d977e4f3ac16ff1a332a020028464/src/vs/workbench/services/extensions/node/proxyResolver.ts#L331\r\n\r\nIt seems like in the URL always is searchParams, and condition for URL will be forever false\r\n\r\nAlso, you can execute this function in the example project (attached file)\r\n1. Run in the folder with an example project to execute native https.request\r\n```\r\nnpm run test\r\n```\r\n2. Run the extension and choose command in palette\r\n```\r\nTest proxy resolver\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis issue occurs when all extensions are

PR resolves #34330 by adding support for [git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt/), a tool which encrypts and decrypts files as a git filter.\r\n\r\nCurrently VS Code does not properly show diffs for files that are encrypted on the `remote` but decrypted locally.\r\n\r\nHere is some of the current behavior:\r\n\r\nA file will have no changes (see below that `production.yaml` doesn't show up in the `git status` panel) but will show in the editor that the whole file was modified:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/549323/66243607-0002cd80-e6ba-11e9-94ad-d827f300813c.png)\r\n\r\nWe can see here when bringing up the inline diffs, that it's comparing the decrypted local file with the encrypted `HEAD` version:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/549323/66243651-2a548b00-e6ba-11e9-9a6c-e4a5a5bfeb2a.png)\r\n\r\nLastly, when the file is changed (shown below as showing up in the `git status` on the panel), and the `git diff` is opened, the diff isn't shown because the left side is the binary version:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/549323/66243697-67208200-e6ba-11e9-8d08-48fe61039ced.png)\r\n\r\nThis PR is fairly simple, and doesn't attempt to solve the total scope of adding generic support for any and all filters. However, I hope this can get accepted in the meantime before that solution is realized to support this specific issue.\r\n\r\nThis PR checks after a `git show` to see if the buffer contains a [magic word](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt/blob/master/commands.cpp#L460) that indicates it is a `git-crypt` encrypted blob. If it is, then it runs it into `git-crypt smudge` which will decrypt the contents appropriately. This resolves all of the cases mentioned above.\r\n\r\nA potential implementation for solving the generic issue would be to read `.gitattributes` for the file being `git show`'d and see what the `filter` is and hand that as the program to execute the blob on. However, this would require significantly more testing which was out of scope for the work I'm doing."}]
