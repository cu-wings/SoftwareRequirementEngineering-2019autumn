pattern when dealing with bidirectional channel is:\r\n```\r\nchannel.onSomeEvent(event => handleEvent(event));\r\n...\r\nconst response = await channel.sendCommand(params);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we consider the other side of the cannel, it often sends events in between request and response:\r\n```\r\nhandleSomeCommand(args): {\r\n  ...\r\n  this.sendSomeEvent(params);\r\n  ...\r\n  return result;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis generates the following sequence of messages: `[someEvent, someCommandResponse]`, which is handled by the channel in the order of `someEvent, someCommandResponse`.\r\n\r\nHowever, `someEvent` is then dispatched synchronously (see `onSomeEvent` above), while `someCommandResponse` is handled through a promise (see `await sendCommand` above). More general, various event handlers and command response handlers contain arbitrary promise chains of different lengths before being handled. This turns commands/events which did arrive in the right order during a single `javascript task` - into handlers which run in absolutely different order due to different chains of `javascript microtasks`.\r\n\r\nTo guarantee the order of processing between various events and command responses, we can artificially insert `javascript task` boundaries between them. This ensures that any `javascript microtasks` related to the first event/response handling will finish before the next event/response is processed, no matter how long the promise chain was, thanks to the javascript tasks spec.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81399","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81399/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81399/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81399/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/81399","id":497945079,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0OTc5NDUwNzk=","number":81399,"title":"On non-Windows, the debug command line expects a `sh` compliant shell","user":{"login":"SteveL-MSFT","id":11859881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODU5ODgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/11859881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveL-MSFT","html_url":"https://github.com/SteveL-MSFT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveL-MSFT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveL-MSFT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveL-MSFT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveL-MSFT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveL-MSFT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveL-MSFT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveL-MSFT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveL-MSFT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveL-MSFT/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTgxNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTgxNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2019-09-24T21:59:43Z","updated_at":"2019-10-02T03:32:17Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.38.1\r\n- OS Version: macOS 18.7.0\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

This generally works well but can cause issues with Git functionality in other tools. We use VS Code for development and it's a pain to not have the integrated diff functionality when reviewing changes of encrypted files.\r\n\r\n**Current Situation**\r\n\r\nThe `.gitattributes` file is modified to add the necessary [filter](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes) attribute (amongst others) so git works as expected when checking out, merging etc. Lots of other tools will set attributes as well.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the basic git commands will work in VS Code but not the diff functionality due to the way the extension uses git show to obtain the file content which bypasses any settings in `.gitattributes`. \r\n\r\nCurrently a user will receive the following message:\r\n\r\n> The file is not displayed in the editor because it is either binary or uses an unsupported text encoding\r\n\r\nAlthough our use case is for git-crypt specifically, this issue affects any tool that relies on `.gitattributes` being properly supported. We have focused on the `filter` attribute only as this is the only attribute we have discovered a need to support at present.\r\n\r\n**Overall Approach**\r\n\r\nAll changes occur in the git extension (`extensions/git`)\r\n\r\n1. *No breaking API changes*. All changes are accomplished via addition of optional parameters so existing functionality will be unaffected. The external extension API interface in `src/api/api1.ts` has deliberately not been modified at present. Once the implementation has been validated and tested then consideration should be given to whether this should be updated. \r\n\r\n2. Support has been added to call [git check-attr](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-check-attr) to check relevant file paths for a `filter` attribute. This is exposed via `getGitFilter`.\r\n\r\n3. Git URIs have been modified to support an extra `filter` parameter to indicate if a filter is required to be used to obtain the content of a git object. \r\n\r\n4. `getURI` in `commands.ts` has been modified to check the filter defined (if any) for a given path. If a filter is set, this is passed to `detectObjectType` so it can detect the correct encoding of the content by passing through filter. It is also added to the URI.\r\n\r\n5. The `show` in `repository.ts` now takes the optional filter parameter (as provided by URI). This will be cause content to be piped through the filter prior to being returned.\r\n\r\n**Some Future Considerations**\r\n\r\n1. Would it ever be worthwhile to add a configuration option to skip filter checking in `getURI`?\r\n2. May require further improvements to check for the filter attributes using `.gitattributes` as per the relevant Git reference instead of `HEAD`. However, current functionality is very useful and support for this use case can be added later.\r\n3. Requires use of `shell` option when spawning child process for `git show` so output can be piped to filter (which is in an unknown location). Although there is a possibly security risk here this is arguably not any greater than the user using relevant git commands which will in essence perform the same activity. However, need to ensure this works on all supported platforms and confirm this rationale."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81391","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81391/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81391/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81391/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/81391","id":497870576,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0OTc4NzA1NzY=","number":81391,"title":"Code insiders editor has been blurry ","user":{"login":"thkrishn","id":7133450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMzM0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7133450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thkrishn","html_url":"https://github.com/thkrishn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thkrishn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thkrishn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thkrishn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thkrishn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thkrishn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thkrishn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thkrishn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thkrishn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thkrishn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":556079247,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NTYwNzkyNDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/electron","name":"electron","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":1343123530,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzQzMTIzNTMw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/electron-6.0.x-update","name":"electron-6.0.x-update","color":"fbca04","default":false},{"id":556743778,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NTY3NDM3Nzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/font-rendering","name":"font-rendering","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":286886536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyODY4ODY1MzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/upstream","name":"upstream","color":"dcdcdc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"deepak1556","id":964386,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NDM4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/964386?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556","html_url":"https://github.com/deepak1556","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"deepak1556","id":964386,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NDM4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/964386?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556","html_url":"https://github.com/deepak1556","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2019-09-24T19:05:44Z","updated_at":"2019-10-14T19:04:20Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"[image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7133450/65541809-d9c37d80-dec2-11e9-9bd7-8b8375b8c0e7.png)\r\n\r\nI use both insiders and the release vs code ; insiders is visibly blurry \r\nvs code :\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7133450/65542001-3757ca00-dec3-11e9-9dab-74b19ae336e8.png)\r\n\r\n\r\ncode Insiders:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7133450/65542047-4e96b780-dec3-11e9-85d8-9088c9e74199.png)\r\n\r\nI am not sure if the difference is visible in the screen shots \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.

Problem\r\nRemote extensions current each implement their own version of port forwarding, including their own configuration and UI related to port forwarding (see the ssh and containers extensions for example). Even with just two extensions supporting port forwarding, the UX around port forwarding is not consistent and we have duplicated development effort. This problem will  become worse as more extensions / scenarios add support for port forwarding\r\n\r\nAdditionally, VS Code has a built-in tunneling mechanism that can be used to implement a limited version of port forwarding even if the remote extension doesn't directly support it. There is currently no UI for managing these tunnels. Managing these will become important if we allow extensions to open new tunnels, as #81131 proposes\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\nBuild a unified port forwarding user experience that the remote extensions can contribute to. This would act somewhat like the existing `Remote Explorer` contribution\r\n\r\n**High level UX Needs**\r\n- List ports currently being forwarded\r\n    - Include human readable names\r\n    - Maybe include type (through VS Code's built-in tunnel service, through remote, external, ...)\r\n- Let user close one of these ports\r\n- Let user open a new port forwarding\r\n\r\n**High level extension API needs**\r\n- A way for VS Code to call out to the remote extension to create a new port forwarding. We also need to be able to tear down this connection (probably just make the result of the api call disposable)\r\n- A way for a remote extension to tell us about port forwardings managed outside of VS Code (see [ssh's `LocalFoward` support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh#_always-forwarding-a-port) for an example of this)\r\n    - We likely also need a way so that the extension can signal that its external port forwardings have changed\r\n- Possible: provide a list of candidate ports for forwarding but that require user action to establish? (see the [containers port forwarding ux](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_temporarily-forwarding-a-port) for an example of this)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n/cc @Chuxel for general

The amount of space is so small, it's difficult to get to the first position. Depending on where the mouse is located, you actually can see the mouse change to the text icon, but are unable to click before the first character. The mouse has to be entirely over the first character to get the cursor to the location prior to the first character. \r\n\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?:

An issue I ran into is VSCode's attempt at opening the last open files / windows in the last session when launching the app. I don't have the exact same files on both machines, and would actually just prefer that VSCode portable would distinguish between the two machines and save a set of open windows / files on for each machine.\r\n\r\nAs a result, when I open VSCode on machine 1, it attempts to open some files that are not present on that machine, which in turn makes VSCode not attempt to open those files when launching on machine 2, which do have the files.\r\n\r\nAlternatively I have to maintain two portable versions of VSCode: VSCode-iMac and VSCode-MacbookPro. Currently this is the only feasible option if I want to use portable, but it doubles the disk space usage. Duplicating the app is particularly cumbersome with VSCode because it's a an app that has ~10^4-10^5 files, many more than a typical app. Most of the files are very small, yes, but the sheer amount of files being changed frequently makes VSCode Portable very sync-heavy. All of this is to say, I'd prefer not to have two copies of VSCode for that reason, but I'd still prefer to use portable mode for other reasons (e.g. no need to install on fresh systems + ability to use on system without admin access).\r\n\r\nThe best would be the ability to group machines together \"these two machines are work, these two are personal\", allowing the use of one single portable installation for many machines, some sharing the same purpose and set of available projects/files, but otherwise sharing the same extensions and setup by virtue of being one portable installation."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81337","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81337/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81337/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81337/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/81337","id":497361026,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0OTczNjEwMjY=","number":81337,"title":"Insert Line After KeyBinding cannot be overridden","user":{"login":"VohuMana","id":7939816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5Mzk4MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7939816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VohuMana","html_url":"https://github.com/VohuMana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VohuMana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VohuMana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VohuMana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VohuMana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VohuMana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VohuMana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VohuMana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VohuMana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VohuMana/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":398766855,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzOTg3NjY4NTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-find","name":"editor-find","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":297959291,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc5NTkyOTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/keybindings","name":"keybindings","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjkyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjkyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2019-09-23T22:33:05Z","updated_at":"2019-10-01T12:49:17Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\nIssue Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\n**Issue**:\r\nIn VSCode version 1.38.1 when I tried to find and replace all in a file using \"Ctrl+Enter\" a message popped up saying \"Ctrl+Enter now inserts line break instead of replacing all.

VSCode Version: 1.38.1\r\n- OS Version: Win10 (10.0.17763)\r\n\r\nThe following used to work in .NET Core 2.2 app with a debug profile for the `externalTerminal` in earlier versions of VSC (or OmniSharp if that's where the problem actually lies here), but it doesn't work with new 3.0 framework bits and the latest public VSC.\r\n\r\nDebug a .NET Core app in the `externalTerminal` using either the `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web` or `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Worker` project SDK that calls [UseConsoleLifetime](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.hosting.hostinghostbuilderextensions.useconsolelifetime) on the host builder so that the app should listen for `Ctrl+C` to stop the app. The app doesn't stop.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a .NET Core console app with [UseConsoleLifetime](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.hosting.hostinghostbuilderextensions.useconsolelifetime) ...\r\n\r\n   ```csharp\r\n   public class Program\r\n   {\r\n       public static async Task Main(string[] args)\r\n       {\r\n           using (var host = Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)\r\n               .UseConsoleLifetime()\r\n               .Build())\r\n           {\r\n               // Start the host\r\n               await host.StartAsync();\r\n   \r\n               // Wait for the host to shutdown\r\n               await host.WaitForShutdownAsync();\r\n           }\r\n       }\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   The preceding code works if the app is run with `dotnet run` in a command shell ...\r\n\r\n   <img width=\"503\" alt=\"Capture1\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1622880/65440864-027a4300-ddef-11e9-8b9a-c9a1d8033818.PNG\">\r\n\r\n2. Use a console debugger profile and run the same app in the `externalTerminal` ...\r\n\r\n   ```json\r\n   {\r\n      \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\r\n      \"configurations\": [\r\n          {\r\n              \"name\": \".NET Core Launch (console)\",\r\n              \"type\": \"coreclr\",\r\n              \"request\": \"launch\",\r\n              \"preLaunchTask\": \"build\",\r\n              \"program\": \"${workspaceFolder}/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.0/ConsoleSample.dll\",\r\n              \"args\": [],\r\n              \"cwd\": \"${workspaceFolder}\",\r\n              \"stopAtEntry\": false,\r\n              \"console\": \"externalTerminal\"\r\n          }\r\n       ]\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   The app will not respond to `Ctrl+C`. In prior versions (.NET Core 2.2), `Ctrl+C` would work when using the `externalTerminal` in this scenario.\r\n\r\nI asked ASP.NET Core engineering, and they thought it might be on the VSC-side of the equation given that `Ctrl+C` works when the app is run in a command shell. See item response **4** at https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore.Docs/issues/12841#issuecomment-533206352.\r\n\r\nI put up a repro project at https://github.com/guardrex/ConsoleSample.\r\n\r\nThe sample app that I put up also has a keystroke-monitoring service that logs presses of the `w` key. That code works. Running in the `externalTerminal`, the app reports that it hears the `w` key clicks, while the app doesn't respond to `Ctrl+C`. Sure, the app could listen for `Ctrl+C` there and shut the app down, but that's not the point ... that would be a hack. `UseConsoleLifetime` should work the way that this app works in a normal command shell (*I think* :smile:).\r\n\r\n**Does this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?** That can't be checked because the configured debug type is `coreclr`, which isn't supported without either (or both) C# OmniSharp. In fact, I'm not sure if this bug report should be filed here or over on https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81313","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81313/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81313/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81313/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/81313","id":497031091,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0OTcwMzEwOTE=","number":81313,"title":"Extension development: Add debug-hover-like data navigation to regular hovers","user":{"login":"PEZ","id":30010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/30010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PEZ","html_url":"https://github.com/PEZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PEZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PEZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PEZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PEZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PEZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PEZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PEZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PEZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PEZ/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":290465400,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTA0NjU0MDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/api","name":"api","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":294817667,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTQ4MTc2Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/editor","name":"editor","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689392,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODkzOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"dcdcdc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"octref","id":4033249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzMyNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4033249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/octref","html_url":"https://github.com/octref","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/octref/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/octref/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/octref/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/octref/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/octref/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/octref/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/octref/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/octref/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/octref/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"octref","id":4033249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzMyNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4033249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/octref","html_url":"https://github.com/octref","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/octref/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/octref/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/octref/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/octref/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/octref/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/octref/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/octref/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/octref/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/octref/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2019-09-23T11:05:29Z","updated_at":"2019-10-07T07:20:13Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"My extension (Calva, a Clojure extension) connects the editor view with the REPL running ”inside” the application under development.
