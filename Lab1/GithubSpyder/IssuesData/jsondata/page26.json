Recently I have started to experience the following behaviour:\r\n\r\n* I run the extension under the debugger and the Extension Development Host runs.  I activate my extension.\r\n* I close the Extension Development Host.\r\n* VS Code triggers a debug break in an internal VS Code function called `afterWriteDispatched`.  It displays an exception popup and the code location where the exception occurred.  The error is `write EPIPE`.  None of my code appears to be on the stack at this time.\r\n* After a few seconds, the debug toolbar and exception popup disappear.  The internal file remains open.\r\n\r\nAlthough this seems harmless, it's a bit annoying, and it does make me anxious that there's something I'm doing wrong.  This never used to happen but I'm not sure whether it started due to changes in my extension or changes in VS Code; it now happens more often than not.  Other extensions I maintain do not seem to be hitting this problem so I can well believe it's an extension problem but the error message doesn't give me any clue where to look!\r\n\r\nThe operating system is Windows and the extension source code is at https://github.com/Azure/vscode-kubernetes-tools/\r\n\r\nHere's a screenshot of the error (sorry, it doesn't stay around long enough for me to copy as text):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/865538/61844991-99ad4200-aef5-11e9-974a-abe455316ddd.png)\r\n\r\nAnd a screenshot with the full file

VSCode Version: 1.35.1\r\n- OS Version: Fedora 30\r\n- git version: 2.21.0\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nThere are no steps to easily reproduce this bug. Once it happens, I can reproduce it until I restart VSCode. Restarting code does \"fix\" this until it happens again. It has been happening to me about once a month for over a year since well before 1.34.0. I am constantly updating vscode, and the bug constantly keeps happening. When it does happen:\r\n\r\n1. I click in the gutter to see the git differences\r\n2. I decide I want to revert that line and then\r\n3. Changes all over the file are applied. While I can \"undo\", this can be dangerous when I don't notice the entire file was just corrupted.\r\n4. Ctrl+Z and repeating will cause it to happen again and again. So once it happens, it is repeatable until I restart VSCode\r\n\r\nI do a lot of git on the CLI, but I can't figure out if I do anything to make this happen. In this particularly well documented case, here's what happened this time:\r\n\r\n1. I have been editing a lot of files, adding and committing from the git CLI\r\n1. The git status was clean, no uncommitted changes.\r\n1. I **opened** `executor.py` and I notices that the gutter said I had 7 hunks modified through out the file. I thought that was odd, since I knew my git environment was clean, and so I \"viewed\" the hunks to see what the changes were.\r\n1. The totality of the changes were from changes that I **committed** on The 22nd, 19th, and 17th\r\n    1. I started VSCode at 1:15 PM on July 17th. \r\n    1. I believe I also rebased this particular branch on July 17th too. I'm fuzzy on the exact timing for that.\r\n1. I saw the 7 changes, reverted one, and noticed I got this same file corruptuption error that I've been trying to replicate so I can make this issue. I saved:\r\n\r\n- The [original file](https://pastebin.com/iFfP0sVA) The file as it was committed on the 22nd\r\n- The [file1](https://pastebin.com/Mt97VErs) after I reverted the very first hunk change, which should have just been a space\r\n- The [file2](https://pastebin.com/w5gA4yv2) after I Ctrl+Z the previous and reverted just the second hunk change\r\n- The [file3](https://pastebin.com/PcFmNvRT) after only the third hunk\r\n- The [file4](https://pastebin.com/ymfZaBNA) after only the forth hunk\r\n\r\nIf you diff these, you will see that ever hunk that I didn't revert, was duplicated on a later line. This has happened to me several times in the past, and the effects are not always as trivial.\r\n\r\nFor example, the diff from the original to file1 should be\r\n\r\n```\r\n59c59\r\n<                       'implementation changed?')\r\n---\r\n>                        'implementation changed?')\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut is instead\r\n\r\n```\r\n61c61\r\n<         # Is not running nor revoked nor finished :/\r\n---\r\n>                        'implementation changed?')\r\n129c129\r\n<             if not fut.cancel():  # pragma: no cover\r\n---\r\n>           logger.debug1('Celery task \"%s\" canceled.', ar.id)\r\n137c137\r\n<             fut.set_running_or_notify_cancel()\r\n---\r\n>           logger.debug1('Celery task \"%s\" running.', ar.id)\r\n143c143\r\n<           # Future is FINISHED\r\n---\r\n>           logger.debug1('Celery task \"%s\" resolved.', ar.id)\r\n148c148\r\n<           # Future is FINISHED\r\n---\r\n>           logger.debug1('Celery task \"%s\" resolved with error.', ar.id)\r\n194c194\r\n<         pass\r\n---\r\n>       except RuntimeError:  # pragma: no cover\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Notice**: The line numbers are off by 2\r\n\r\nOther info:\r\n\r\n- I'm working in a submodule, I'm almost always working with submodules\r\n- The \"Source Control\" pan in VSCode shows the correct branch name for the submodule, `unit19_rebase1`\r\n- I do have GitLens, but this part of vscode is [unrelated to GitLens](https://github.com/eamodio/vscode-gitlens/issues/759)\r\n- The ↻ in the git window doesn't help any.\r\n- I checked out detached head, and now the Source Control Providers area shows the correct sha, not just the branch name. So VSCode does know the right sha, but still produces this error\r\n- I closed the file and opened it again (Leaving VSCode open the whole time) and the problem continues to reproduce.\r\n- Restarting VSCode did make the problem go away (until it happens again)\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Cannot test, as this bug is too rare, and restarting makes it go away until the next time it occurs. Currently, I've been running VSCode for 5 days (no sleep or hibernation)\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77826","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77826/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77826/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77826/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/77826","id":471787476,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NzE3ODc0NzY=","number":77826,"title":"http

Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nI can't figure out the exact repro steps, but I've had this happen several times, starting immediately after I updated from the last version of vscode:\r\n\r\nThe cursor gets drawn one character before the actual location. For example, in a typescript file I click past the end of the line, but the cursor gets drawn before the ; at the end of the line. However if I start typing the new text is added after the semicolon.\r\nClosing the file and re-opening it seems to fix it for a while, but the problem eventually comes back.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time I've seen this in VS Code, although I've seen a similar issue in Monaco before. When we see it there the cursor is usually offset less than an entire character, so it get's drawn on top of the character preceding the cursor location\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.36.1

The extension creates a command  that sets up the debugging environment (e.g. starts services) before launching a given debug configuration by name.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**\r\n\r\n0. Create a new workspace (any target should do).\r\n\r\n1. Define a configuration structure similar to this: \r\n\r\n_settings.json_\r\n```\r\n...\r\n\"launch\": {\r\n  \"configurations\": [\r\n    { \"name\": \"Config_A\", ... }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"compounds\": [\r\n     { name: \"Compound\", \"configurations\": [ \"Config_A\", \"Config_B\" ] }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n...\r\n```\r\n_launch.json_\r\n```\r\n...\r\n\"configurations\": [\r\n  { name: \"Config_B\" , ...  }\r\n]\r\n...\r\n```\r\n2. From the Debug drop down, select \"Compound\" and run. \r\n**This works.**  \r\n\r\n3. Create an extension that runs this line (a workspace must be loaded): `vscode.debug.startDebugging(vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders[0], 'Compound')` \r\n **This fails** with \"Configuration 'Compound' is missing in 'launch.json'\".\r\n\r\n**Questions**\r\n\r\n1. Should step 2 (run from drop down) work? It seems to me it should not:\r\n\r\n    - According to this page: https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/debugging, _Tip: If a workspace contains a \"launch.json\", the global launch configuration is ignored_.\r\n\r\n   - According to `WorkspaceConfiguration.inspect` documentation,  local values (launch.json) should override global (settings.json). This works _strictly_ as documented. For the provided repro: `Workspace.getConfiguration('launch').get('configuration')` only returns configurations in _launch.json_ (i.e. arrays are not merged),  `Workspace.getConfiguration('launch').get('compounds')` only returns compound configurations in _settings.json_ (i.e. because _launch.json_ does not define a _compounds_ value). Using `WorkspaceConfiguration.inspect`  I can verify all configuration values exists and are overriden as intended.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.

This commit changes it to select the scope (or a rough\r\nproxy of that), rather than the line's indent. This is not a complete fix for #49342, as this\r\ndoes not add support to semantic detection, however, this will work in\r\nprobably 90% of the cases, and is a relatively straightforward fix.\r\n\r\nIn general, this works:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/647786/61643606-87d46080-aca3-11e9-80b0-e607be76d78b.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/647786/61643629-93278c00-aca3-11e9-9a79-89409638dff1.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/647786/61643959-28c31b80-aca4-11e9-8733-5797dbb867d0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, there are still edge cases where this does not work correctly, since it's not really semantic, it's just based on the indentation of the above and below lines.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/647786/61643705-b2261e00-aca3-11e9-8366-d856b749f104.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/647786/61643742-c36f2a80-aca3-11e9-8577-9860d03d24df.png)\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, this does work in Notepad++ at least:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/647786/61653842-81ea7980-acbb-11e9-8ad5-52fdb4bea9e3.png)\r\n\r\nThis is a relative edge case, and this should solve the problem in most codebases, but not all. The correct solution of course is to find the indents based on semantics, which is what #49342 is about, so I don't think this actually closes the bug totally, and so suggest it remain open. However, solving that problem is a bigger task, and requires a large amount of changes in the model, so in the meantime I think this is a good stopgap, and anyways is an appropriate fallback for plain text and unknown syntax.\r\n\r\nWhere begin/end scope is ambiguous, for instance in yml, where there aren't really \"end scopes\" per se, it prioritizes it as a begin scope:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/647786/61645001-08945c00-aca6-11e9-9164-505460c39a38.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is strange behavior when the configured indents don't line up with the indents in the source. These are hidden by the current behavior, but now my PR exposes them in a weird way.\r\n\r\nCurrent version:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/647786/61645168-62952180-aca6-11e9-9a5e-92bea8b7986d.png)\r\n\r\nMy version:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/647786/61645230-835d7700-aca6-11e9-885e-e04b3156e30a.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/647786/61645249-8b1d1b80-aca6-11e9-9959-df69fa8981c2.png)\r\n\r\nThis makes the odd behavior a bit more obvious, but I think the underlying issue is that the indent detection isn't semantic anyways, it's entirely based on the number of spaces compared to the configured indent size. The issue here is that a, b, c, d, and f (but not e and second a) are in the 0th scope, and e and second a are in the 1st scope, because tab settings are set to 4 spaces. I'm not sure what to do about this.\r\n\r\nI should also mention that this will not do the appropriate indentation in Allman's style if the line above the `{` is selected, as mentioned in #53737, but I think that's probably ok, as correct behavior will be seen if the bracket is selected."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77756","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77756/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77756/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77756/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/77756","id":471101131,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NzExMDExMzE=","number":77756,"title":"Ubuntu: “unlock your keyring” on startup","user":{"login":"elieobeid7","id":660142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDE0Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/660142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elieobeid7","html_url":"https://github.com/elieobeid7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elieobeid7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elieobeid7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elieobeid7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elieobeid7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elieobeid7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elieobeid7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elieobeid7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elieobeid7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elieobeid7/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODk0MjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"E2A1C2","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"deepak1556","id":964386,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NDM4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/964386?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556","html_url":"https://github.com/deepak1556","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"deepak1556","id":964386,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NDM4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/964386?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556","html_url":"https://github.com/deepak1556","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2019-07-22T13:38:51Z","updated_at":"2019-10-09T21:05:00Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm using ubuntu 16.04 unity 64 bit and the latest version of VSCode.

Problem\r\n\r\nDevelopers [don't know](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44629890/what-is-a-workspace-in-vs-code) what a [workspace is](https://www.reddit.com/r/vscode/comments/9z1b34/totally_confused_by_workspaces_and_folders_in/). Here's [my recent attempt to clear up the confusion](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57134632/4500152).\r\n\r\n### Confusion\r\n\r\n- The [recent list widget](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces#_opening-workspace-files) groups folder workspaces along with `.code-workspace` workspaces under a \"workspace\" heading, indicating that everything in that list is a workspace. Then it gives `.code-workspace` workspaces a \"Workspace\" suffix, contradicting the header, and indicating that only those workspaces that are associated with a `.code-workspace` file are true workspaces. \r\n\r\n- The first interaction with the term \"workspace\" for most developers is going to be the workspace settings. This is setting up users for confusion right off the bat. Because a folder's `.vscode` settings is initially referred to as \"Workspace\" settings. But when a `.code-workspace` file is created, `.vscode` settings becomes \"Folder\" settings, while the `.code-workspace` settings becomes the new \"Workspace\" settings.\r\n\r\n- \"Open Workspace\" is referring to a `.code-workspace` workspace (with the dialog only allowing a `.code-workspace` file to be selected). Same goes for \"Add Folder to Workspace...\" and \"Save Workspace As...\".\r\n\r\n- An extension's \"Disable (Workspace)\" option is referring to workspace as defined by my definition in the SO post.\r\n\r\n### Suggestion\r\n_**NOTE**: Suggestions will be updated as discussion in this thread evolves._\r\n\r\n- In the recent list widget, create two separate headings: \"Workspace\" and \"Folder\". Remove suffixes.\r\n- In settings editor, always refer to specific settings with the same reference. \"Workspace\" tab for `.code-workspace` settings. \"Folder\" tab for `.vscode` settings.\r\n- \"Open Workspace\", \"Add Folder to Workspace...\", and \"Save Workspace As...\" remain unchanged.\r\n- An extension's context menu will show \"Disable (Workspace)\" or \"Disable (Folder)\" depending on which is currently active.\r\n- Optionally, come up with another term when wanting to reference both definitions. Whether it's \"Project\" or something else. Then it would be acceptable to use \"Disable (Project)\" in the extension's context menu, for example."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77710","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77710/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77710/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77710/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/77710","id":470738902,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NzA3Mzg5MDI=","number":77710,"title":"support game controller so I can map buttons on it","user":{"login":"graph","id":1088059,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODgwNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1088059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/graph","html_url":"https://github.com/graph","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graph/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graph/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graph/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graph/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graph/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graph/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graph/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graph/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graph/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODkzOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"dcdcdc","default":false},{"id":297959291,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc5NTkyOTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/keybindings","name":"keybindings","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMTQxMjEyNA==","number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODcwNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":1680,"closed_issues":5342,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2019-10-14T16:35:16Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2019-07-21T03:54:01Z","updated_at":"2019-08-08T11:40:43Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"for example I don't have a side scrolling mouse so it would be nice if I could use my game controller analog stick to scroll all directions.

Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates.\r\n\r\nDuplicate of locked https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/40956 , which redirected the discussion to https://github.com/atom/language-shellscript/issues/100 , where I was told it's no longer their problem:\r\n\r\n>> VSCode is still using the old TextMate grammar, which the Atom team no longer maintains as we have moved many grammars (including this one) over to Tree-sitter.\r\n\r\n·\r\n\r\n> Also please test using the latest insiders build to make sure your issue has not already been

Create a bash file `moo.sh`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\nnl <(sed -nre 's!^\\s+!!p' <<'  __FOO__'\r\n  ########################\r\n  ## Dummy Message      ##\r\n  ########################\r\n  __FOO__\r\n  )\r\necho bar\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Compare with [my screenshot](https://abload.de/img/heredocigjr2.jpeg).\r\n3. Run it and observe that bash considers \"echo\" a command of its own.\r\n4. Unident `__FOO__` to see the flipside of this bug: VSCode now thinks everything is ok.\r\n5. Run again, see that in reality, unindenting broke it:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n./moo.sh: line 2: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `)'\r\n./moo.sh: line 9: syntax error: unexpected end of file\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?:
