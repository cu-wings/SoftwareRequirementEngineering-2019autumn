Source Control: Git\r\n\r\n### Description:\r\n\r\nFiles are able to be staged/unstaged even if a commit is currently in progress. This can lead to accidental file commits or the opposite (accidentally removing a file from a commit). \r\n\r\nI did not expect to be able to change the set of the files once a commit has been initiated and assumed any subsequent stages would be queued for a future commit or perhaps it would be possible to disable the stage/unstage buttons when a commit is running?\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Have multiple files changes in your repo\r\n2. Stage one of these files\r\n3. Enter a message and and press Cmd+Enter to commit\r\n4. Stage another file whilst step (3) is still running \r\n\r\n### Result\r\nThe file staged in step 4 is now included as part of the commit initiated in step 3. **Step 3 may take a while, for example if automatic code formatting or unit tests are run as a pre-commit hook.**"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/51675","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/51675/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/51675/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/51675/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/51675","id":331475929,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMzE0NzU5Mjk=","number":51675,"title":"Feature:

when you install extension it will be installed in global scope (used for all projects), I think it can be useful to have settings to set default installation scope, such as `current workspace`, `global scope`, maybe even `current session`. Because:\r\n\r\n1. If you use VS Code for many different projects (different languages/frameworks) you will load unneeded extensions every time that will slow down start up \r\n2. Some extensions can have conflicts between each other\r\n3. Some extensions is badly written and can throw error messages if they can't find required files in current workspace\r\n4. Maybe you need to use this extension rarely or only once.\r\n\r\nIt should be allowed to change this setting from user settings. Possible values:\r\n\r\n1. Current workspace \r\n2. Global workspace (installation default)\r\n3. ??? Current session (not sure if this needed, but some extensions used quite rare, for example screen sharing or something similar)\r\n\r\nAlso it should be possible to select one of this options from combobox in extension store.\r\n\r\nIf this will be approved I want to handle pull request for this issue.\r\n\r\nMaybe related to:\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/49826\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/47053\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/51638","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/51638/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/51638/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/51638/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/51638","id":331335281,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMzEzMzUyODE=","number":51638,"title":"Can't have full screen video from Edge while VS has context","user":{"login":"toddbellMSFT","id":38890212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODkwMjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/38890212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddbellMSFT","html_url":"https://github.com/toddbellMSFT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddbellMSFT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddbellMSFT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddbellMSFT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddbellMSFT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddbellMSFT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddbellMSFT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddbellMSFT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddbellMSFT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddbellMSFT/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":556079247,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NTYwNzkyNDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/electron","name":"electron","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":272689423,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODk0MjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"E2A1C2","default":false},{"id":286886536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyODY4ODY1MzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/upstream","name":"upstream","color":"dcdcdc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMDY5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMDY5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-06-11T20:20:27Z","updated_at":"2019-10-08T14:23:36Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\nIssue Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nI am watching e3 ubisoft press conference https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-e3-2018-press-conference-live-stream/1100-6459517/ \r\n\r\nwhich is full screened on my left monitor. \r\n\r\nMy right monitor has VSCode and VS 2017. 2017 works fine.

non handled promises are not logged at all (so was impossible to know where the error happened).

Don't know / don't have the time to investigate if the real issue is when the promise is created instead of in this part of the code.
