Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nHI!\r\nThere are inconsistent behaviors when find toolbar is open in editor.\r\nwith different scenarios:\r\n\r\n - When I open an empty file, and I press Ctrl+F, the editor is shifted below the find toolbar, and line 1 starts from an inappropriate place, like the find toolbar is shifting what is under it:\r\n![screenshot 16](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5755214/50052572-53139000-013b-11e9-91b3-d8cb33d6ab84.png)\r\n    and when I start typing something, a more shifting happens, which (seems) is caused by that little git annotation.\r\n\r\n- also there is some inconsistent behavior with this find toolbar on non-empty files. If I have the find toolbar open and then open a non-empty line, git-annotation on first line is not shown. But if I first open the non-empty file and then press Ctrl+F, everything looks fine:\r\n![screenshot 18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5755214/50052620-01b7d080-013c-11e9-8da7-6f44e09d8a04.png)\r\n![screenshot 21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5755214/50052622-03819400-013c-11e9-8f5b-ab65ed990346.png)\r\n![screenshot 19](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5755214/50052625-0ed4bf80-013c-11e9-9f54-65ef3b03465f.png)\r\n\r\nTHANKS!

I recently enabled smooth selection caret rendering, and I noticed that for moving to the end of longer lines, the number of frames rendered are about half or less than what is rendered by my mouse going at the same distance and speed. I have a 144hz monitor, and 144 is more than double 60, which would confirm my test results.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I can get 144 frames per second in Chrome, tested via https://www.testufo.com/ and compared with Firefox running at 60 frames per second.\r\n\r\nWhat I would like is the possibility of rendering VS Code at a frame rate higher than 60.

Make the file icon on the left turn into the X close icon when the user is mousing over the tab.\r\n\r\nIf the above changes were made, there are some benefits:\r\n\r\n- All tabs will take up less room, because no space is reserved for the close button.\r\n- Closing sequential tabs is easier, as you can place your mouse over the left side close button, tap close, and the next tab slides over with the close button directly under your mouse, so you may continue closing tabs. (I'm aware of the various Close Tab options available if you right-click on a tab, but sometimes you just want to quickly close a sequence of tabs.)\r\n\r\nThe only downsides I can think of:\r\n\r\n- Might not adhere to some platform UI guidelines. ¯\\\\\\_💩_/¯ \r\n- User has to mouse over the tab to discover where the close button is.

Rationale:\r\n\r\nThe \"Task: Run Task\" picker puts the most recently used task as the first one in the list (with other recently used tasks), which makes it easy to re-run the same task without typing.\r\n\r\nThe same behavior is not present for the input pickers (both `\"pickString\"` and `\"promptString\"` pickers), which makes it harder to re-run the same task if the arguments were not the default ones.\r\n\r\n### Details:\r\n\r\nConsider the following tasks.json file:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n\t\"version\": \"2.0.0\",\r\n\t\"tasks\": [\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\"label\": \"echo free\",\r\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"shell\",\r\n\t\t\t\"command\": \"echo ${input:any}\",\r\n\t\t\t\"problemMatcher\": []\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\"label\": \"echo list\",\r\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"shell\",\r\n\t\t\t\"command\": \"echo ${input:list}\",\r\n\t\t\t\"problemMatcher\": []\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t],\r\n\t\"inputs\": [\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\"id\": \"list\",\r\n\t\t\t\"description\": \"arguments in a list\",\r\n\t\t\t\"default\": \"a\",\r\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"pickString\",\r\n\t\t\t\"options\": [ \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" ]\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\"id\": \"any\",\r\n\t\t\t\"description\": \"any arg\",\r\n\t\t\t\"default\": \"\",\r\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"promptString\"\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf my development workflow requires me to run \"echo list\" with argument \"c\" frequently (i.e. building a specific module in a big project), I can quickly find the right task (it is likely at the top of the recently used tasks inside the Run Task picker), but I will still have to lookup or type the argument (and in my real-life use case, the argument is not a single letter, and the list has ~150 elements). Having a \"recenty used input\" list would be helpful for this.\r\n\r\nThe same goes for a \"echo free\"-like task (I have this case passing custom arguments to a build system script, as I would do in a shell, but with a problemMatcher parsing the output), but as the arguments are not selected from a list, the number of \"recently used inputs\" would probably have to be limited to a sane level.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/65044","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/65044/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/65044/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/65044/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/65044","id":390941234,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzOTA5NDEyMzQ=","number":65044,"title":"[pug]

Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nI understand this is still an open issue.   It continues to be a problem that text cannot be selected using a digital pen or with touch.\r\n\r\nVSCode is basically usless to use when a user does not have a mouse and keyboard.  I can't select text with the Microsoft Surface digital pen or via touch.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Windows 1809 software keyboard has a regression that it will close the software keyboard when the shift+arrow key is pressed to select text.  In the previous release this was an issue but was eventually fixed.\r\n\r\nVSCode cannot be limited to mouse and physical keyboard.   \r\n\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.30.0

Launch VSCode to under debugger\r\n\r\nResults -> Logging exceptions occur (such as)\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: Failed opening file C:\\Users\\emclemen\\AppData\\Roaming\\Code\\logs\\20181209T201113\\cli.log for writing: Permission denied\r\n    at new RotatingLogger (C:\\Users\\emclemen\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code\\_\\resources\\app\\node_modules.asar\\spdlog\\index.js:16:3)\r\n    at Object.t.createSpdLogService (C:\\Users\\emclemen\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code\\_\\resources\\app\\out\\vs\\code\\node\\cliProcessMain.js:70:564)\r\n    at Object.t.main (C:\\Users\\emclemen\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code\\_\\resources\\app\\out\\vs\\code\\node\\cliProcessMain.js:177:299)\r\n    at C:\\Users\\emclemen\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code\\_\\resources\\app\\out\\vs\\code\\node\\cli.js:123:343\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes\r\n\r\nThe log-file service (src\\vs\\platform\\environment\\node\\environmentService.ts) is setting the log-file directory path into the process environment block.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    constructor(private _args: ParsedArgs, private _execPath: string) {\r\n        if (!process.env['VSCODE_LOGS']) {\r\n            const key = toLocalISOString(new Date()).replace(/-|:|\\.\\d+Z$/g, '');\r\n            process.env['VSCODE_LOGS'] = path.join(this.userDataPath, 'logs', key);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        this.logsPath = process.env['VSCODE_LOGS']!;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a result, if VSCode ever gets reloaded (which only really reloads a portion of VSCode), or launches a process (in the case of debugging), then the logging tries to open up a file that is already in use. The permission denied you are getting is not really an accurate error from the spdlog. What it is really getting is an sharing violation.\r\n\r\nI believe the fix for this is quite simple which is to store a static inside the class rather than trying to use the environment block.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    private static processLogFilePath : string | undefined;\r\n\r\n    constructor(private _args: ParsedArgs, private _execPath: string) {\r\n        if (!EnvironmentService.processLogFilePath) {\r\n            const key = toLocalISOString(new Date()).replace(/-|:|\\.\\d+Z$/g, '');\r\n            EnvironmentService.processLogFilePath = path.join(this.userDataPath, 'logs', key);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        this.logsPath = EnvironmentService.processLogFilePath;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/64893","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/64893/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/64893/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/64893/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/64893","id":390283955,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzOTAyODM5NTU=","number":64893,"title":"Sort lines should sort entire file when there is no selection","user":{"login":"massung","id":746946,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0Njk0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/746946?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/massung","html_url":"https://github.com/massung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massung/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":426116471,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MjYxMTY0NzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-contrib","name":"editor-contrib","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":272689392,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODkzOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"dcdcdc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDc4OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDc4OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2018-12-12T15:42:47Z","updated_at":"2019-01-07T07:43:08Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nUsing the built-in line sorting, I have a sample case where the lines sort incorrectly.

[[See this issue here]](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/51956) for some background on my previous feature request related to this. \r\n\r\nI have gotten pretty decent at getting what I want through CSS injection stuff but sadly this seems to have some pretty hard limitations. \r\n\r\nYou can see here the current state of my theming: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9451726/49693645-6a042200-fb3e-11e8-876e-6090b520dce8.png)\r\n\r\nI have added padding to the `<` of the opening tags. In developer tools, this means that I can add a little extra space on the left hand side so that the border of the box model and the `<`  have a little bit more visual room to breathe. But if this padding is added through injection, it does not work. It appears that whatever is being given the colored border is also not in the DOM and is being rendered behind the `<` in a way that is unaffected by the injected padding rules. There is padding applied but the relative position of the border is unchanged and instead other things around it are being rendered. I also can try adding a border in dev tools and that border renders separate from the one rendered upon load which seems to indicate that my understanding of them being separate parts of the DOM etc is correct. \r\n\r\nAlso, I realize that that reason why padding isn't an exposed property for most tokens is probably because most coders use monospaced fonts. I don't though! And aside from necessary places like the CLI where composition relies on monospace there isn't any really necessary reason why coders should be limited to monospaced fonts. The font I use, Input Sans, is a proportional font specifically designed for code, and it works great. Furthermore, padding could be just set in em which is pegged to character size right? So like on a monospaced font, I assume 1em = 1 character space. So anybody who does have a monospaced font and REALLY wants to keep their proportions, then they could. \r\n\r\nAlso I'll just say I still think it would be a good idea to officially document what the mtk# classes are related to. I've actually started figuring out the general pattern just by  constantly fiddling with stuff, and now that I've got a general idea I actually converted my injected css into a scss project so that I could use nesting to keep more organized and write dryer code etc. \r\n\r\nJust let us hack it! There's no point being coy about this stuff.

would be great to distinguish top-level extensions such as Extension Pack and \"flat\" extension, which is not included in any pack.\r\nThe idea is to have list grouped by features. e.g.:\r\n\r\nEnabled [V]\r\n+ \"Java language Pack\"\r\n   - \"Debuger for Java\"\r\n+ \"Python language Pack\"\r\n- \"Some small extention\"\r\n\r\nDisabled [V]\r\n+ \"Java language Pack\"\r\n   - \"Maven for Java\"\r\n- \"Fortran support\"\r\n\r\nThere are some possible solutions:\r\n1. Show extensions list as tree.\r\n2. Add possibility to hide dependent extensions"}]
