am working on adding an API to my extension, so that other extensions can build on top of what mine offers.

It's also a bit painful for debugging as I can't debug the installed-from-VSIX API provider extension; I have to add `console.log` statements and then do the rebuild/uninstall/reload/install dance again.\r\n\r\nCould you provide a way to load two extensions simultaneously into the Extension Development Host, so that I can run my API provider and API test/sample alongside each other?

I'm usually developing on mac and then testing the same code in a VM on linux. This is a cmake/c++ project so the build artifacts are already separated by specifying different build directories (outside the source tree). The only issue I have is with the workspace .vscode directory - I'd like the linux box to use a different directory than .vscode - for example .vscode-linux. This way I can keep separate workspace settings, launch, intellisense, etc. The name of the .vscode directory should be saved in the users settings.json (so it's global for this user) - once configured vscode should always try to open workspace .vscode-linux on that machine. \r\n\r\nThe source tree would than look like this:\r\nmySrc/.vscode/*\r\nmySrc/.vscode-linux/*\r\nmySrc/src/\r\nmySrc/test/\r\n\r\nHopefully the workspace name '.vscode' is not hardcoded in a million places and is always obtained via a function call ;) \r\n\r\nThe workaround I have is using symlinks:\r\nmyLinkedSrc/.vscode/\r\nmyLinkedSrc/src@ -> ../mySrc/src\r\nmyLinkedSrc/test@ -> ../mySrc/test\r\nmyLinkedSrc/CMakeLists.txt@ -> ../mySrc/CMakeList.txt\r\n\r\nBut that would not work on windows. \r\n\r\nSorry if this is a duplicate of some other request - I did my best, but searching for \"vscode\", \".vscode\", \"workspace vscode\" is a bit challenging :)"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/72189","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/72189/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/72189/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/72189/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/72189","id":432423484,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MzI0MjM0ODQ=","number":72189,"title":"Trying to paste primary selection on replacement box instead pastes in editor","user":{"login":"LinAGKar","id":3390621,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTA2MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3390621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinAGKar","html_url":"https://github.com/LinAGKar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinAGKar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinAGKar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinAGKar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinAGKar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinAGKar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinAGKar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinAGKar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinAGKar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinAGKar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":398766855,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzOTg3NjY4NTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-find","name":"editor-find","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjkyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjkyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2019-04-12T07:22:50Z","updated_at":"2019-04-12T08:09:17Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"1.

Create two auto closing pairs in a language configuration file,\r\n```JSON\r\n\t\"autoClosingPairs\": [\r\n\t\t{\"open\": \"(\", \"close\": \")\"},\r\n\t\t{\"open\": \"(*\", \"close\": \"*)\",  \"notIn\": [\"string\"]},\r\n\t],\r\n```\r\n2. trying using the two character auto closing pair, `(*` and you will get `(**))`.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you remove the ending ')' from the closing '*)' you almost get normal function, except that in cases where `(` doesn't auto close with `)`, you get `(**`.\r\n\r\nNote this condition exists in #57838, in a reference to the Structured Text Language, though it is not shown in the example on that feature request.  Reference the repository https://github.com/Serhioromano/vscode-st for some example.\r\n\r\nI think the Auto Closing logic needs to consider when auto closing pairs might conflict with each other.  In this case, '(**)' overlaps with '()'.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/72174","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/72174/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/72174/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/72174/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/72174","id":432332743,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MzIzMzI3NDM=","number":72174,"title":"VS Code keeps losing the ability to see files in some of my folders","user":{"login":"rfernand2","id":4296158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTYxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4296158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfernand2","html_url":"https://github.com/rfernand2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfernand2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfernand2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfernand2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfernand2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfernand2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfernand2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfernand2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfernand2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfernand2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":301327312,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDEzMjczMTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/file-explorer","name":"file-explorer","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":578047123,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NzgwNDcxMjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/under-discussion","name":"under-discussion","color":"dcdcdc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"isidorn","id":1926584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjY1ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1926584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn","html_url":"https://github.com/isidorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"isidorn","id":1926584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjY1ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1926584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn","html_url":"https://github.com/isidorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2019-04-12T00:11:00Z","updated_at":"2019-10-08T14:43:34Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nJust running latest version - I can see the files at my windows command line, but VS Code shows the folder as empty (I click to expand it, it opens with no entries).

is pull request slash invitation to discussion.\r\n\r\n#63813 seems to be stalled and i seem to be stuck on cpptools 0.19 where this bug isn't reproducible. I can't use cpptools past 0.19 because it spawns unwanted terminals which is major distraction/productivity killer. Also i'm not really a TS programmer, i'm only doing this because i have to, so please be considerate when reviewing.\r\n\r\nPR adds `terminal.external.linux.pressAnyKeyToContinue: true` option (opt-in) to enable \"Press any key to continue...\" message at the end of launch/debugging session on Linux (specifically related to vscode-cpptools).\r\n\r\nNote this line:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// const pressAnyKeyToContinue = (envVars['VSCODE_TERMLAUNCHER_WAIT'] !== undefined);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is alternative variant of the same without the need to introduce any options, terminal launcher behavior can be adjusted by setting \"environment variable\" (actually key in env vars map) `VSCODE_TERMLAUNCHER_WAIT` in `launch.json` like this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"environment\": [{\r\n                    \"name\": \"VSCODE_TERMLAUNCHER_WAIT\",\r\n                    \"value\": \"NONONO\",\r\n                }],\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is also opt-in.\r\n\r\nDoes it look good or what is need to be fixed?\r\n\r\nCC: @weinand @pieandcakes

There are multiple extensions (e.g. Azure Functions) that support streaming logs along with standard Git/Terraform/etc. output views, and being able to specify log highlighting on a per output window basis would go a long way to ensuring richer log views and more constant use of the Output Window.\r\n\r\n### Potential Implementations\r\n\r\n1. Add a feature flag to add the window name to the output window mime type. For example if my Window is named Git then its mime type would be text/x-code-output-Git, if my window is named Terraform than mime type would be text/x-code-output-Terraform. \r\n\r\nNow .tmlanguage highlighters can be registered on a per window name basis and different extensions can contribute different syntax highlighters for output windows rather than one \"Global\" one.\r\n\r\nThis would ensure broadest compatibility and probably least development effort, but more dynamic output window names may be tricky (perhaps allow wildcards in mime type definition for .tmlanguage)\r\n\r\n2. Make this more explicit, such as registering an output window handler contribution and having vscode handle it natively, or have the extension specify the handler or mime type for the output window to ensure consistency.\r\n\r\nBoth 1 and 2 can be implemented together to cover both explicit and implicit specification

Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nWhen I open a large file (tried on `.php` and `.html`) and `emmet.triggerExpansionOnTab` option is enabled, then each pressing on <kbd>TAB</kbd> key (even on blank line) make my computer hung for about 1-2 seconds (depends on file size) with high CPU load.\r\n\r\nThis is true with current 1.33 version of VS CODE, with or without extensions (tried with `code --disable-extensions`), with or without project open. I also tried to download 1.34 insiders build and the behavior is still the same.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Download a fresh 1.34 insiders build (or use 1.33 current).\r\n2. Create new HTML file `tmp.html` with any content. Make sure it is 2000+ lines. Better 5000+ - the hang is more obvious when the file is more large. I attached an [example file](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/files/3059147/tmp.html.zip) here.\r\n3. Set cursor on any line and press <kbd>TAB</kbd>. You can press it many times in a row or press and hold - all should be fine.\r\n4. Open `preferences` and enable `Emmet: Trigger Expansion on Tab` option (`emmet.triggerExpansionOnTab`).\r\n5. Return to opened file and try to press <kbd>TAB</kbd> again. You should see a very notable delay between pressing the key and moving the cursor (you can enable `Toggle render whitespace` option to see this better).\r\n\r\n    If you press and hold the <kbd>TAB</kbd> key for about 5 seconds, then you should see no spaces/tabs characters entered (but notice high CPU load), you then can move cursor to anoter place in the editor, and after another 10-30 seconds have been passed (all that time with high CPU load), the delayed space characters will appear at the current cursor position (not where the cursor been when you actually pressed the <kbd>TAB</kbd> key).\r\n\r\nSo here is two problems:\r\n\r\n1. A high CPU load and delay between pressing <kbd>TAB</kbd> key and appearing of spaces/tab characters.\r\n2. The space/tab characters appears after the delay not where the cursor was when <kbd>TAB</kbd> key was pressed, but at the current position of the cursor.\r\n\r\nI notice this problem only recently. I'm not sure with which build this comes in (not used VS Code recently), but 1-2 month ago there were no this problem.\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code - Insiders 1.34.0-insider

especially it animates to a wider size. \r\n![image](https://i.stack.imgur.com/yNg0R.png)\r\n\r\nThe red indicates the area where the fold button is responsive:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10471270/55762229-1257c380-5a17-11e9-89ac-f40096a38f97.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10471270/55762329-6367b780-5a17-11e9-948d-a1c4d2104f63.png)\r\n\r\n## Problem:\r\n\r\n1. As an end-user perspective who uses code folding frequently, I should be able to click near by the fold button to fold code consistently. \r\n2. I do not want to accidentally click on other function. (Especially the peek because it messes with the layout expectation and creates frustration).\r\n3. When the git changes bar appears, I'm unable to click the fold consistently.\r\n    - About 33% of the fold button's original responsive area is taken by git changes bar\r\n    - The animation naturally makes a user clicks on it since it responds to location point on fold button.\r\n    - User may never use git change peek. I personally will open Working-tree instead of peek when I need to examine the git changes. \r\n4. There is no way to configure the git changes bar nor fold button. The only way to turn off git changes bar is to disable git. \r\n![image](https://i.stack.imgur.com/cfHH3.png)\r\n\r\n## Feature request\r\n1. User should be able to turn on and off of the git changes bar\r\n2. User should be able to disable the git changes bar's animation\r\n3. The interface should have a consistent margin between fold button and git changes bar when the bar animates\r\n4. User should be able to relocation change bar to other place, such as the break point area indicated in red:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10471270/55763141-a1b2a600-5a1a-11e9-8aac-a06480dabc9b.png)\r\n5. User should be able change action on click line number, currently, click on it selects the line.\r\n    - I personally like to do triple click on the line to select line, it is easier and intuitive, enable user action on line number click can make user work more effectively.

Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nI have been seeing hangs happen on and off since 1.33 was in insiders, but never pinpointed anything. And while I still haven't pinpointed anything the frequency has increased (even at the very end of 1.33). I have noticed that the hangs very often coincide with kicking off a task (usually it is a compound task).\r\n\r\nHow best can I help capture information to get to the bottom of it? When it happens the window is hung completely so I can't open devtools or anything like that.\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code - Insiders 1.34.0-insider (0ab39f4148f242e7b0802330385fc99b4845aa31, 2019-04-08T05:19:58.162Z)\r\nOS version: Windows_NT x64 10.0.18362\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>System Info</summary>\r\n\r\n|Item|Value|\r\n|---|---|\r\n|CPUs|Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700K CPU @ 4.00GHz (8 x 4008)|\r\n|GPU Status|2d_canvas: enabled<br>checker_imaging: disabled_off<br>flash_3d: enabled<br>flash_stage3d: enabled<br>flash_stage3d_baseline: enabled<br>gpu_compositing: enabled<br>multiple_raster_threads: enabled_on<br>native_gpu_memory_buffers: disabled_software<br>rasterization: enabled<br>surface_synchronization: enabled_on<br>video_decode: enabled<br>webgl: enabled<br>webgl2: enabled|\r\n|Load (avg)|undefined|\r\n|Memory (System)|31.93GB (18.83GB free)|\r\n|Process Argv||\r\n|Screen Reader|no|\r\n|VM|0%|\r\n</details>\r\n<!-- generated by issue reporter -->"}]
