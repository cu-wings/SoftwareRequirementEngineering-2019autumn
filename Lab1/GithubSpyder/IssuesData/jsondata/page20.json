Consider allowing to locally generate keyboard cheat sheet PDFs with the currently used shortcuts from within vscode.\r\n\r\nIt's nice to have beautifully designed cheat sheets for the keaboard shortcuts (#14071).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately they neither take into account localization nor customization.\r\nSo while for the former it would be great if you provided PDFs for the default keymaps for the most prevalent keyboard layouts on your website (not just en-us), the more general solution this ticket is about is to allow vscode to _locally_ create PDFs with the current keyboard settings, if that's not too much of a overhead technically.\r\n\r\nWhile this might open the gates for further requests like picking other commands' shortcuts to be displayed on the cheat sheet or reordering or regrouping the commands or redesigning the sheet itself, I assume it's a perfectly reasonable middle ground to enable users to just generate the very same cheat sheet with the very same design, set of commands, grouping, ordering etc, but taking into account the shortcuts actually set by the user."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/79491","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/79491/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/79491/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/79491/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/79491","id":482689451,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0ODI2ODk0NTE=","number":79491,"title":"Code

The server returns code actions for various issues. I noticed that if a user chooses to apply a code action (for example, that deletes a line), the editor doesn't clear the diagnostic, or ask the server again for updated code actions. This results in the user being able  to apply the code fix again and again, deleting more valid lines.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI've wrote a small repro [here](https://github.com/OmarTawfik/vscode-extension-samples/commit/050a3ce18b3def49c3f551e07e8472fbd21ac891). Simply open the extension and run using `Client + Server` launch configuration.\r\nThe sample provides code actions to delete duplicate empty lines. The user is able to delete more valid lines by re-applying the code action. Here is also a video of this happening:\r\n\r\n![code-action-repro (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15987992/63326726-b0bb3600-c2e1-11e9-9f2f-0dc0884009ce.gif)\r\n\r\nUnless there is something wrong with the sample server implementation, the editor shouldn't allow applying the same code action twice to the same document, as it produces invalid contents.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/79483","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/79483/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/79483/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/79483/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/79483","id":482635314,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0ODI2MzUzMTQ=","number":79483,"title":"autoAttachChildProcesses

Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nIn the latest VSCode release (1.37.0) there seems to be a regression in markdown rendering feature, in that some of the URL parameters are incorrectly getting encoded .  \r\n\r\nRepro steps\r\n\r\n1. Create a markdown file and put following url  content in it and save the file:\r\n```\r\n<!-- Begin markdown -->\r\n[Sample Link](https://myhost.com/Redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bing.com%3Fsearch%3Dtom)\r\n<!-- End markdown -->\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Click this link in markdown, see that the URL that is passed to browser is:\r\n\r\nhttps://myhost.com/Redirect?url=http://www.bing.com%253Fsearch=tom \r\n\r\nNotice that the %3F in the _url_ parameter in the markdown link has been further encoded into %253F\r\n\r\nExpected: \r\nThe URL that is passed to browser is either for the two below\r\n1. https://myhost.com/Redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bing.com%3Fsearch%3Dtom\r\n2. https://myhost.com/Redirect?url=http://www.bing.com?search=tom\r\n\r\nThis issue is true for other surfaces of markdown as well, like the 'Details' tab of installed extensions and the hover popup set through text decorations, via the vscode.DecorationOptions class.\r\n\r\nThis issue does not repro in older version of

Watch Computer Possibly Explode - High CPU usage causes terrible slow downs, sometimes WindowsServer restarts.\r\n\r\n**Note:** I disabled extensions before reporting this issue. It still occurs.\r\n\r\nIt's something I've had issues with since VS Code was first released. It's also not consistent. Sometimes things are fine for a brief period of time, then *something* happens and it starts eating CPU. Other times, like during my submitting this issue, it'll happen right away and then disappear after a period of time. But quite often, when it does happen, it ends up requiring me force quitting VS Code processes and trying again.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can't supply any of the projects where this occurs due to copyright. But the sites are built on AspDotNetStorefront and hosted on a Windows 10 VM locally. It's not the smallest project but it's not really *that* large either. I have even ignored many directories hoping that will help - it doesn't appear to.\r\n\r\nThanks for listening.\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.37.0 (036a6b1d3ac84e5ca96a17a44e63a87971f8fcc8,

webview extensions do not currently set a [content security policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP). All webviews (even very simple ones) should set a content security policy. This is not a immediate security problem but a content security policy helps to limit the potential impact of content injections and is generally a good measure for defense in depth. \r\n\r\nI've put together this initial list of extensions that create webviews that seem not to have a content security policy (there may be false positives). If you are feeling like a security hero, **consider helping these extensions out by submitting a PR that adds a restrictive content security policy to their webviews**.

Apply dark theme\r\n2. Apply customizations to settings checkboxes, for example:\r\n```\r\n        \"settings.checkboxBackground\": \"#FFFFFF\",\r\n        \"settings.checkboxForeground\": \"#009c00\",\r\n        \"settings.checkboxBorder\": \"#404142\",\r\n```\r\n3.
