Run a python file using command palette      >Python: Run file in terminal window\r\n2. Terminal shows the output. Now, clear the terminal using command palette     >Terminal: Clear\r\n3. Terminal gets clear now.  Run the file again in the terminal    >Python: Run file in terminal window\r\n4. Here is where issue shows up - the terminal still shows all the previous outputs from before the last clear command.  IMO, desired should be that terminal should not show any previously cleared outputs.\r\n5.

(Note: All except the \"Python\" extension were disabled.  Python extension is needed to run the python file in terminal.\r\n\r\nI had also posted in Super User forum thinking this was some issue with my system. And then I tried it on a clean build of VS code and it got repeated.  Hence, I decided to post it as a bug. \r\n\r\n[Link to Super User forum question](https://superuser.com/questions/1446320/vs-code-terminal-clear-command-not-working-as-desired)\r\n\r\nVS Code version:

Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->\r\n\r\nTypically to open the colour picker in VS Code when doing CSS, you simply hover your cursor over the colour value and let it show up. However, if you hover or click on the colour swatch to the left of the colour value, it will do nothing other than positioning the cursor next to it.\r\n\r\nIn Visual Studio Code's Interactive Playground, the CSS tip below the first small editor window mentioned: \"These swatches also act as colour pickers that allow you to easily change a colour value.\" However, the swatches do nothing other than to show colour. If that is the case, wouldn't it be better to say that \"these swatches preview colour...\"?\r\n\r\nSo, I would suggest allowing the colour picker to be shown when clicking the colour swatches (also would suggest using the \"Link Select\" (or the hand) cursor to indicate something clickable).\r\nThe same colour picker can still be shown when hovering above the colour value, since hovering over stuff should show quick info."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75135","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75135/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75135/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75135/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/75135","id":453801668,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NTM4MDE2Njg=","number":75135,"title":"editor.trimAutoWhitespace

The value is added to the `Context` under the `viewItem` key as before. The implementation of `Context.getValue` has been updated to treat `a.b.c` as a lookup of the key `a` followed by accesses to the `b` property on `a` and the `c` property on the result of `a.b`.\r\n\r\n**Backward compatibility concerns**\r\nAre there existing context keys that contain `.`, other than for `config.*`, which is handled in a special `IContext` implementation?\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nI have not yet implemented any tests for the new feature. It appears that there are existing contextKey tests, but only for the expression parser and evaluator. Should I just add more tests for `Context`?
