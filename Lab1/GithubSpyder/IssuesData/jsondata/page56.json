It offers a simple API that allows the installation of Extensions via the command line, but those extensions are only installed into the current users profile directory. This brings the problem that every user on the systems (= a Terminal Server) needs to install the extensions for him/herself. Moreover - in my scenario - this system is air-gapped (not connected to the internet). Therefore it is impossible for the user to download extensions and I do not want every user to hassle with the installation of Extensions.\r\n\r\nFeature Request:\r\nIt would be nice if not only VSCode offers silent installation but also either an API that allows the installation of plugins into a central folder (not the user profile; e.g. %VSCodeInstallDir%\\extensions or ...data\\extensions) which then holds extensions or - even better - just a folder where an .visx-file can be extracted without the need for an vscode.exe API call and that then every instance of VScode automatically loads (and maybe additionally the extensions residing in the users' profile, with newer extensions taking priority over old ones).\r\n\r\nThis would make the deployment (e.g. via SaltStack) of VSCode and it's extensions especially in air-gapped multi-user environments much easier."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/67979","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/67979/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/67979/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/67979/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/67979","id":407221370,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MDcyMjEzNzA=","number":67979,"title":"Mouse pointer using default windows theme on linux","user":{"login":"aulospl","id":12572896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTcyODk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/12572896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aulospl","html_url":"https://github.com/aulospl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aulospl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aulospl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aulospl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aulospl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aulospl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aulospl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aulospl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aulospl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aulospl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjkyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjkyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2019-02-06T12:53:14Z","updated_at":"2019-02-06T17:02:39Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"When I mouse over the line number in the editor, the mouse pointer reverses as usual, but it uses the default Windows pointer instead of the one defined by the current cursor theme.

Type: <b>Feature Request</b>\r\n\r\nThis is a common scenario for build tasks especially for docker. If I want to build the dockerfile that will use a specific file in a workspace folder, I need to be able to target the dockerfile in that workspace assuming one dockerfile per workspace folder. A variable like ${fileWorkspaceFolder} would work.\r\n\r\n${workspaceFolder} returns the folder of the tasks.json file but I need a task in there to do something different based on the workspace folder I'm in.\r\n\r\nThere's a second way to solve this in that tasks.group.isDefault should automatically only work for the tasks.json file in the workspace folder I'm in.\r\n\r\nIn the former case, I'd use a global tasks.json and use the proposed ${fileWorkspaceFolder} variable. In the latter case, each workspace folder would have it's own tasks.json but the tasks.group.isDefault boolean would work to select the task in the workspace of the current file (thereby not forcing me to pick which of the isDefault tasks it should run)\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.30.2 (61122f88f0bf01e2ac16bdb9e1bc4571755f5bd8, 2019-01-07T22:54:13.295Z)\r\nOS version: Windows_NT x64

Open empty Python file.\r\n2. Type the following: `print(f'hello {0}` . The result should look like this:\r\n   ```python\r\n   print(f'hello {0}|')\r\n   ```\r\n   `|` here denotes cursor position. Note that closing quotation mark and closing paren were injected automatically.\r\n3. Now press `Del` to delete closing quotation mark. The result should look like this:\r\n   ```python\r\n   print(f'hello {0}|)\r\n   ```\r\n4. Finally, press `'` to insert quotation mark.\r\n\r\n### Expected result\r\n```python\r\nprint(f'hello {0}'|)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actual result\r\n```python\r\nprint(f'hello {0}'|')\r\n```\r\nSo it seems it incorrectly deduced that my quotation mark was the opening one, and injected the closing one.\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n- VS Code version: 1.30.2 (user setup)\r\n- Extension version (available under the Extensions sidebar): 2019.1.0\r\n- OS and version: Windows_NT x64 10.0.17134\r\n- Python version: CPython 3.7\r\n- Type of virtual environment used: N/A\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\nNothing that I consider relevant.

Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->\r\n<!-- Also please test using the latest insiders build to make sure your issue has not already been fixed: https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/ -->\r\n**Description**\r\n\r\nWe are developing the 'AL language' extension in VS Code and we are using MarkupContent in order to display our intellisense/on hover documentation as specified on the Language Server Protocol [specifications](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/blob/gh-pages/specification.md).\r\n\r\nAs part of our documentation, we also display some images. We are using Markdown and base64 images (ex: `![MyImage](data:image/png;base64,myImageValueInBase64)`). This works, but, the size of the documentation panel is not correct when displaying the image the first time (when visiting the second time, this is fixed). \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31541422/52174569-05f48780-2796-11e9-8e01-12bc9e62c14f.gif)\r\n\r\n<!-- Use Help > Report Issue to prefill these. -->\r\n**Version**\r\n- VS Code Version: 1.31.0-insider (system setup)\r\n- Commit: 8f56013e8f66650c1b0b65cc5c502691e307db21\r\n- Date: 2019-02-01T18:34:04.940Z\r\n- Electron: 3.1.2\r\n- Chrome: 66.0.3359.181\r\n- Node.js: 10.2.0\r\n- V8: 6.6.346.32\r\n- OS: Windows_NT x64 10.0.17763\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\r\n\r\n1. Download the 'AL Language' extension from the marketplace.\r\n\r\nName: AL Language\r\nId: ms-dynamics-smb.al\r\nDescription: AL development tools for Dynamics 365 Business Central\r\nVersion: 2.1.79379\r\nPublisher: Microsoft\r\nVS Marketplace Link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dynamics-smb.al\r\n\r\n2. Create a new AL project.\r\n- Ctrl + Shift + P - to open the command bar\r\n- Select 'AL:Go' - to create a new AL project\r\n\r\n3. When asked to choose a server or do enter user credentials, just skip it, this is not needed in order to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\n4. Open the HelloWorld.al that was auto-generated, and replace it by the following code:\r\n(the character ^ represent the cursor location for the next step).\r\n```\r\npage 50120 MyPage\r\n{\r\n    actions\r\n    {\r\n        area(Processing)\r\n        {\r\n            action(ActionName)\r\n            {\r\n                Image = ^\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Remove ^ and trigger intellisense at this location.\r\n\r\n**Expected**: The image (sent as base64 image) should appear.\r\n**Actual**: The image is only partially displayed as the display window is too small. This gets fixed the second time the image is displayed (see gif above). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: I have no other extension installed than the AL one.\r\n\r\n**Related issue in our repository**: [Image preview of action Image property not fully visible](https://github.com/Microsoft/AL/issues/4413)"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/67784","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/67784/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/67784/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/67784/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/67784","id":405966419,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MDU5NjY0MTk=","number":67784,"title":"Multiline
