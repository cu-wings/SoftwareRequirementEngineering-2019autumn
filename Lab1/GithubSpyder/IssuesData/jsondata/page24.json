Proper Windows behavior seems to be to not restore in the snapped state.  Checking to see if this is something I can PR.\r\n\r\n- [x] Fix the keybindings for Find in Files\r\n\r\n> The keybindings one is about how awkward the defaults are. Up/Dn change the search contents rather than moving focus to the results which is vastly more likely. Ctrl+Dn moves to results but Ctrl+Up doesn't return to the search box in 99% of cases.\r\n\r\n* Alt+Up/Down used to be the way to scroll search history, but people were expecting Up/Down (Sublime, Atom, see https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/23099 as an example)\r\n* Using keybindings is the right way to override this behavior, so capturing it here: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/78655  \r\n\r\n- [x] Can't toggle maximized editors\r\n\r\nFixed with https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/72968, would be even better with https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/73453\r\n\r\n- [ ] Reporting issues is a time

Type: <b>Performance Issue</b>\r\n\r\nPerformance of the buffer is severly degraded when the system color profile is set to anything other than sRGB. I believe this is related to an underlying issue with Chromium ([821020](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=821020), [791828](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=791828), [989904](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=989904)). There is a workaround in some other Chromium-based apps (e.g., Chrome), which allow the profile off the app to be distinct from the system profile. I have not been able to figure out a way to provide such an override with VS Code. Until the issue with Chromium is fixed, having the ability to set the color profile specifically for VS Code would be extermely helpful.\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.36.1 (2213894ea0415ee8c85c5eea0d0ff81ecc191529, 2019-07-08T22:56:38.504Z)\r\nOS version: Darwin x64 18.7.0\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>System Info</summary>\r\n\r\n|Item|Value|\r\n|---|---|\r\n|CPUs|Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4288U CPU @ 2.60GHz (4 x 2600)|\r\n|GPU Status|2d_canvas: enabled<br>flash_3d: enabled<br>flash_stage3d: enabled<br>flash_stage3d_baseline: enabled<br>gpu_compositing: enabled<br>multiple_raster_threads: enabled_on<br>native_gpu_memory_buffers: enabled<br>oop_rasterization: disabled_off<br>protected_video_decode: unavailable_off<br>rasterization: enabled<br>skia_deferred_display_list: disabled_off<br>skia_renderer: disabled_off<br>surface_synchronization: enabled_on<br>video_decode: enabled<br>viz_display_compositor: disabled_off<br>webgl: enabled<br>webgl2: enabled|\r\n|Load (avg)|2, 2, 3|\r\n|Memory (System)|16.00GB (1.94GB free)|\r\n|Process Argv||\r\n|Screen Reader|no|\r\n|VM|0%|\r\n</details><details>\r\n<summary>Process Info</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\nCPU %\tMem MB\t   PID\tProcess\r\n   14\t   131\t 69877\tcode main\r\n    0\t    82\t 69878\t   gpu-process\r\n    0\t   197\t 69880\t   window (radiotopia.fm-hosted_zone.yml — Infrastructure)\r\n    0\t    82\t 69980\t     extensionHost\r\n    0\t    49\t 69981\t     watcherService\r\n    0\t    98\t 69982\t   shared-process\r\n    0\t     0\t 70086\t     /bin/ps -ax -o pid=,ppid=,pcpu=,pmem=,command=\r\n    0\t    82\t 70084\t   window (Issue Reporter)\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Workspace Info</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\n|  Window (radiotopia.fm-hosted_zone.yml — Infrastructure)\r\n|    Folder (Infrastructure): 133 files\r\n|      File types: yml(79) py(15) md(11) js(11) DS_Store(7) sh(3) json(3)\r\n|                  yaml(1) gitignore(1) xml(1)\r\n|      Conf files:;\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\nExtensions: none\r\n<!-- generated by issue reporter -->"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/78325","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/78325/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/78325/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/78325/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/78325","id":475621594,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NzU2MjE1OTQ=","number":78325,"title":"Allow easy accepting/rejecting changes from both versions on save conflict","user":{"login":"ezk84","id":1305919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDU5MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1305919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezk84","html_url":"https://github.com/ezk84","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezk84/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezk84/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezk84/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezk84/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezk84/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezk84/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezk84/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezk84/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezk84/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODkzOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"dcdcdc","default":false},{"id":1605428622,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjA1NDI4NjIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/git-merge","name":"git-merge","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":256129996,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTYxMjk5OTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/help%20wanted","name":"help wanted","color":"fef2c0","default":true}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2019-08-01T11:10:29Z","updated_at":"2019-10-10T05:53:17Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"This is the same as #47250 which is closed and locked, but I will try to explain in more detail.\r\n\r\nNormally when there is an SCM merge conflict I can do a side by side comparison, can navigate conflicts one by one and can choose which version to keep (or to keep both) by using commands or buttons on the UI in addition to manual editing.\r\n\r\nHowever, when there is a save conflict (the file I am trying to save has been modified elsewhere since I opened it) I get an error.

Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->\r\nMy usecase is I have a TS project, and besides having VSCode checking my code using tsserver, I also ran **`tsc --watch`** on the side to instantly emit code.\r\n\r\nI was having issues with compilation speed of tsc, and the thing is, after changing my code and as soon as tsserver finishes type checking the code, I want to run it (the emitted JS) right away, but cannot since TSC hasn't finished built yet. \r\n\r\nIt takes about 3-4 seconds to finish the incremental compilation. So I have to constantly switch between the `Problems` panel and `Terminal` to make sure TSC finishes the build.\r\n\r\nThe idea is having the `problemMatcher` config to include status matching as well, for example, \r\n- as soon as `File change detected. Starting incremental compilation...` shows up in the build task's output, we know TSC is building\r\n- after error/success message shows up, we know it's finished. This can be reflected on the status bar, so that I don't have to switch to terminal panel to make sure TSC is done.\r\n\r\nI asked on forum and get back the answer of no such extension/thing exists yet to solve the specific problem. Also I imagine this would benefit other languages/environments as well, for example, \r\n- webserver restart after changing the code \r\n  * this applies to all environments as long as there's anchor texts, and the good thing is, it's totally customizable\r\n- Continuous unit test run\r\n- Scala's continuous build with sbt\r\n\r\nJust to name a few. I can see this being useful for many users as well."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/78248","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/78248/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/78248/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/78248/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/78248","id":474921202,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NzQ5MjEyMDI=","number":78248,"title":"Freeze when collecting search result","user":{"login":"Amadeea","id":6142994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNDI5OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6142994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amadeea","html_url":"https://github.com/Amadeea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amadeea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amadeea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amadeea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amadeea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amadeea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amadeea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amadeea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amadeea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amadeea/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODk0MjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"E2A1C2","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzg3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzg3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2019-07-31T03:48:43Z","updated_at":"2019-10-05T09:47:35Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nUsing find in files feature, type \"iris\" on the search input. \r\nHit Enter\r\nAnd vs code will freeze (cannot do anything including profiling)\r\nI think it is not about too much search result.
