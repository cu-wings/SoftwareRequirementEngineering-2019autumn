In addition, we are supporting a group of high school robotics teams using VS Code for their programming this year, and we're trying to make a 100% offline setup for our users. Over the past year, with OpenJDK 11 becoming full featured, VS Code is now the only part of our product we can not distribute. This makes usability more difficult, as we cannot have a self contained setup. Using the open source builds is not an option for us, as access to the extension gallery is very important to our users, in addition to wanting our users not using custom tools.

'aaa' and input 'a0a' as replacement, then click replace button => ok: 'aaa' was replaced with 'a0a'\r\n3. search 'bbb' and input 'b1b' as replacement and click replace button => ok: 'bbb' was

redo step 4 but do something extra: after using arrow key to switch replacement to 'a0a', changing 'a0a' => 'a0' => 'a0a' then click replace button ok: 'ccc' was replaced with 'a0a'\r\n\r\n+ conclusion: It seems like arrow key operation only changed the UI displayed replacement and forgot to change the real

I don't know how to exactly reproduce.\r\n\r\nI'm using Code Insiders.

Open a versioned folder (must contain .git)\r\n2. Open a file (doesn't need to be versioned but must be saved)\r\n3. The problem appears\r\n4. Unfocus VS Code (click somewhere else on the OS taskbar)\r\n5. Problem disappears in few seconds\r\n6. See \"No source control providers registered\"\r\n\r\nWhen the 'flickering' happens, VS Code seems to be alternating between two states:\r\n- \"Source control: git\" (seems to be scanning .git)\r\n- \"No source control providers registered\"\r\n\r\nOnce VS Code is unfocused, source control dies and stops to be scanned.\r\n\r\nRe-open a file in that folder to re-trigger the issue.\r\n\r\nIn order to make a sreen recording, I had to use the screen recorder keyboard shortcuts, otherwise a click on the \"Record button\" would make the flickering disappear (but source control stays out of service)\r\n\r\nMy _.git_ directory was freshly git-cloned and is thus well-formed\r\n\r\nI never had this problem before updating VS Code today.\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code - Insiders 1.28.0-insider
