Open VSCode\r\n2. Open a Terminal\r\n3. Make keyboard keys input combination of \"AltGr + 2 then Space\" or \"AltGr + 7 then Space\"\r\n4. You get the standard key (unexpected) plus the AltGr key (expected)\r\n\r\nThis happens on an AZERTY keyboard (a Surface Type Cover).

The **1** change badge is displayed, but the change(s) themselves are not.\r\n\r\n### Staging all changes at once:\r\n4b1. Stage all changes.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14353068/66730595-61c6f280-ee85-11e9-815c-2c77abc321ce.png)\r\nNote that only the addition is shown, with no type badge.\r\n4b2. Unstage the file (by clicking the `-` next to the file)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14353068/66730651-a0f54380-ee85-11e9-9dec-6656de8d45d5.png)\r\nThe deletion is now displayed correctly\r\n\r\n### Staging the deletion first:\r\n4c1. Stage the deletion - displays correctly. (same state as 4b2)\r\n4c2.

This is (for me) unexpected behaviour, but does not differ from the way the source control view acts on any Renamed file.

Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->\r\nThe vscode-test package allows you to run integration tests where you launch the tests through vscode and a instance of vscode opens up. But if I want to do normal unit tests against code that has even a single reference to vscode I am not able to do so due to https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6586. There are several workarounds:\r\n\r\n* stick with integration tests (slow, not usable with test explorer UI, and not really usable with command line either†)\r\n* _completely_ extract out your logic to not reference vscode at all. Easier said than done. See https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-wordcount/issues/5#issuecomment-171050759\r\n* mock require to return a mocked vscode (see https://github.com/rokucommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/blob/master/src/BrightScriptCommands.spec.ts)\r\n\r\nNone of these workarounds are ideal. As @georgejecook pointed out \"it seems most people (judging by github repos) simply don’t do a lot of testing\". Making it easier to write unit tests would encourage extension authors to do more testing, thereby decreasing bugs and making users and authors happier.\r\n\r\n† tests ran from command line can't be run while vscode is opened

Brand new install of VS Code on MacOS Catalina. \r\n2. Try to open VS. Get an error.\r\n3. Open via menu, click `Open` on prompt\r\n2. Go to the Interactive Playground\r\n3. \"Initializing JS/TS language features\" shows at the bottom and never goes away\r\n4. Look in the `Errors and Warnings` embedded editor on the Interactive Playground. No errors or warnings are highlighted (or showing anywhere else).\r\n\r\nI also followed the steps from #82130, but the `Typescript:` commands aren't available, so I couldn't retrieve the logs. This was just downloaded, dragged to Applications, and started. No other configurations or updates were made.
