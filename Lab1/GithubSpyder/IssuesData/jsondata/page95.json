Setup user settings according to this\r\n```json\r\n    \"[json]\": {\r\n        \"files.encoding\": \"windows1252\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"files.encoding\": \"utf8\",\r\n```\r\n2.

Create a test.json file with the following content (win1252 encoding) and commit\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"some-test\": \"Some content with win1252 characters\",\r\n\t\"content\": \"ãçÇ~'aàá\",\r\n\t\"test\": \"regular chars\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n4.

Check the git diff. Will report changes on lines 3 and 4 because will convert to utf8 before diff, ignoring the language encoding configuration (win1252)\r\n6. Perform a git diff to see the difference and how it should work properly (only line 4 reported as changed):\r\n```sh\r\n$ git diff test.json\r\ndiff --git a/test.json b/test.json\r\nindex 638f49c..b19527f 100644\r\n--- a/test.json\r\n+++ b/test.json\r\n@@ -1,5 +1,5 @@\r\n {\r\n        \"some-test\": \"Some content with win1252 characters\",\r\n        \"content\": \"<E3><E7><C7>~'a<E0><E1>\",\r\n-       \"test\": \"regular chars\"\r\n+       \"test\": \"regular chars test\"^M\r\n }\r\n```\r\n7.

when the source reference is returned over the debugger protocol, the source is retrived via the debug adapter (ie remote source is always used).\r\n\r\nWould it be possible for vs code to check if the file exists locally, if not then fall back to using the source reference.\r\n\r\nThis would greatly simplify remote debugging , at least in Python. This way user doesn't need to configure any path (local or remote) mappings.\r\n\r\nHere's the work flow:\r\n* In the attach request we'll (extension in vscode) send current work space as the default local root \r\n* On the remote side when attach request is received, we'll map the local root (received) to the current directory (serves as remote root)\r\n* We return mapped paths along with a source reference (in stack traces)\r\n* VSCode will check if the file exists locally, if yes then use that else use the source reference.\r\n\r\nIf on the other hand the user provides the path mappings, the remote debugger will not return source reference (number).

locally.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/47899","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/47899/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/47899/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/47899/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/47899","id":314403137,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMTQ0MDMxMzc=","number":47899,"title":"Allow

be surprised if this hasn't been asked before, but tmux supports a thing it calls \"pane zooming\", if I recall correctly. \r\n\r\nBasically once you start splitting a window, vertically, horizontally, it doesn't matter, you press a certain keyboard shortcut and the current pane is \"maximized\", hiding all the other panes. Text is reflowed, so you actually see the former pane as a full window. This is incredibly useful once you launch some command that has a ton of unexpected output that you want to check out.\r\n\r\nWhen you're done you press the same keyboard shortcut and the pane \"reverts\", showing the previous layout.
