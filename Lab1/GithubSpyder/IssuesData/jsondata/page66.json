Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nThis is very minor but...\r\n\r\nIMO it would be great to align the `Developer: Toggle Developer Tools` and `Developer: Open Webview Developer Tools` commands. I know they are technically accurate, since the former actually toggles, while the latter just opens. But I find that dichotomy an issue (albeit a very minor one).\r\n\r\nFor example, I've seen confusion from a few devs trying to find the dev tools command (because they looked for open first), and then once they learn it is _Toggle_ rather than _Open_, they can't find the webview dev tools which is `Developer: Open Webview Developer Tools`.\r\n\r\nAnd I always find myself typing the wrong thing for what I'm looking for -- sometimes I type _toggle_ when I'm looking for the webview tools, and _open_ for the normal dev tools. And I'm sure your asking yourself why I don't just type `dev` to find them, but for something reason that has yet to stick in muscle memory 😉 \r\n\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code - Insiders

For example, developers could edit markdown files, seeing embedded images right inside the file, or developers could add LaTeX formulas to comments and see them rendered beautifully as math formulas in the code. This would also allow the CodeRush team to port over the [embedded images

there :wave:\r\n\r\nmy extension manages a number of custom workspace configuration settings (established via the `contributes.configuration.properties` object in my `package.json` / manifest file). i monitor these settings using `workspace.onDidChangeConfiguration()` and take action when `event.affectsConfiguration()` signals that a relevant change has occurred.\r\n\r\ni'd like to expose a command that a user can invoke to be walked through the process of updating _multiple_ configuration settings within their workspace. kind of like a set up wizard UX.\r\n\r\nthe problem i'm running into is that there does not appear to be a way to update _multiple_ configuration values at once. \r\n\r\ninstead, i'm forced to update them like so:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nawait config.update('foo', foo, ConfigurationTarget.Workspace);\r\nawait config.update('bar', bar, ConfigurationTarget.Workspace);\r\nawait config.update('baz', baz, ConfigurationTarget.Workspace);\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich causes my `onDidChangeConfiguration()` to be called three times (once for each change). in this scenario, i want to emit _one_ change event once all three settings have been updated.\r\n\r\ni can work-around the current behavior by simply debouncing my event handler or managing some global flag and exiting my event handler early based on whether or not it is set or even just editing the `.code-workspace` json file myself using node's `fs.writeFile`, etc. however, this doesn't prevent 3rd party listeners from running and / or is generally a bit clunky.\r\n\r\nit would be great if there was support for something like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nawait config.update('myExtension', { foo, bar, baz }, ConfigurationTarget.Workspace);\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich would then update those three values but only emit one change
