Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->\r\nApologies if this is a duplicate, but I couldn't find anything.\r\n<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->\r\n\r\nVS code will helpfully highlight linting / grammar errors in a file with a green squiggly line. The location of errors in a file also shows up as a green \"notch\" in the scroll bar area (also very helpful).\r\n\r\nSometimes though, a highlighted grammar error is very small--maybe a single character. In these cases I find it very hard to visually scan a file to find the highlighted section. I oftentimes find myself relying on the scroll bar to show me where an error is by\r\n1. clicking on a line\r\n2. inspecting the scrollbar area to see where the cursor indicator is in relation to the green grammar error \"notch\" indicator.\r\n3. Do a \"guestimate\" of how many lines down the error is in the file, and click on that line.\r\n4. Inspect the scrollbar area to see if the cursor is on the same line as the grammar error.\r\n   - If yes, closely inspect the current line to find the grammar error.\r\n   - If no\r\n     - Is the grammar error above the current line? If so, do a \"guestimate\" of how many lines up the error is in a file and click on that line. Repeat step 4.\r\n     - Is the grammar error below the current line? If so, do a \"guestimate\" of how many lines down the error is in a file and click on that line. Repeat step 4.\r\n\r\nObviously this workflow isn't ideal. It would be very helpful if grammar errors showed up in the line number gutter area on the left side of an open editor pane (in a similar manner to how line additions / deletions receive an indicator in the line number gutter area of a file). This would make visually scanning a file to find a grammar error much easier, as I could use the scroll bar indicator to jump to the approximate area of the grammar error, and then scan the line number gutter area to find the line the grammar error is on.\r\n\r\nSorry if this is a confusing explanation. I don't know of a \"proper\" name for these UI components.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n*Search terms:\r\ngrammar error visibility; linting error visibility; syntax error

I saw another problem with breakpoints not being hit because the sourcemap's `sourceRoot` was wrong (because it was configured incorrectly in the tsconfig.json).\r\n\r\nThe fix was trivial for me, but for a user it is not obvious what the problem is. Hovering over the grey breakpoint just shows a not very informative message \"unverified breakpoint\". \r\n\r\nAnd not many users are aware of the \".scripts\" utility that can be run on the debug console to see the source mappings in detail. And the output of \".scripts\" is a bit verbose and does not highlight errors. See this example from node-debug which has a wrong `sourceRoot` entry in the source map of sourceMaps.js:\r\n\r\n![2018-08-30_11-33-33](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1898161/44843570-e4bcc780-ac48-11e8-86f3-6397339dc2d8.png)\r\n\r\nI think we can and should do better!\r\n\r\nMy proposal:\r\n\r\nFor obvious reasons we cannot show a warning message when an expected breakpoint is **not** hit.\r\nBut we could do an upfront verification pass over all generated files reachable via the `outFiles` globs and if they have a source map reference at the end we can verify that the source map exists and that contained back reference to the source is points to an existing file.\r\nIf the verification process sees error, we could show detailed information about the problem.\r\nIn order to keep the amount of information small, we could limit the verification to only those source files that actually have breakpoints.\r\n \r\nThis verification can be implemented in basically three ways:\r\n- inside the DA in \"launch\" or \"attach\" when the launch config is available. The output of the verification could be send to the debug console in text form and we could either treat problems as fatal and abort debugging or as informative and continue debugging. The verification could use the \".scripts\" tool and verify the paths in its output and only show the errors.\r\n- inside the node-debug extension: here we could verify the launch config and the source maps in the `resolveDebugConfiguration` method which makes it possible to show nicer UI and ask the user whether he wants to continue or abort debugging. Another advantage of doing the verification in the extension code is that the code is shared for both node-debug and node-debug2.\r\n- inside a separate extension. This approach could be useful for any debugger that uses sourceMaps. But since launch configs are not standardized, it is difficult to find and interpret the relevant attributes correctly. \r\n\r\n@roblourens what do you think?\r\n\r\n/cc @dbaeumer

Code is awesome, and others have taken a liking to it as well. So much so that whole IDEs are being built on top of extensions (such as PlatformIO, vs-code-arudino, Flutter, etc.)\r\n\r\nWhat this means is that I typically have VS Code open three/four times (e.g. one for PlatformIO, one for Arduino, one for Python). While it's awesome I can hotswap between them, PlatformIO makes some changes to the UI that only make sense to it (e.g. there's a virtualenv I didn't realize I was in and was wondering why Python3 sources were being interpreted as Python2.7)\r\n\r\nThere's also occasionally extensions that conflict with one another -- For instance, the PlatformIO plugin just does not play well with the Arduino plugin, both try to take over parts of the interface in different ways. \r\n\r\nThere's already setting, `--extensions-dir` and `--user-data-dir` in combination,  that lets you swap what directory extensions are loaded from.
