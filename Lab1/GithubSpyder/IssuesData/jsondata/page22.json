Summary\r\nThis is to track updating our icons to use our new icon font (`codicons`) in the workbench. This will allow us to: \r\n- Style icons dynamically (themeable)\r\n- Allow theme authors to provide color tokens for icons\r\n- Unify Octicons + VS Code icons into a single icon library\r\n\r\nThis would allows to do something like below where icons inherit the foreground color of their element:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"313\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35271042/65706632-b7a33a00-e03f-11e9-8c07-b8d2ebc32fc6.png\">\r\n\r\n_Notice how the icons in the selected element are different a color than the rest state_\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n- Provide library of icons for extension authors #74974\r\n- Twistie/Progress/Octicons/Actions hard to see in light theme when selected #55857\r\n\r\n## Out of scope\r\n- Allow extensions to define icon name via contribution points (requires API changes) https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/31466\r\n\r\n## Adoption areas\r\n- [ ] Activity Bar\r\n- [ ]
