check if a given character is an EOL character, which compares a given character to `\\r` and  `\\n`. While it works on macOS, I've not yet been able to test this in other operating systems and I'd much rather use an already tested and trusted implementation, but I couldn't find it in the existing codebase.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/d58af3cb013fd7678587e62e41c0b8b05225b11e/src/vs/base/browser/ui/inputbox/inputBox.ts#L570-L572\r\n\r\n- As you can see in the linked video, I had to make a few visual design choices (positioning, padding, fixed width, etc.). If you disagree with any of my decisions or if there is anything else that I can do to improve this implementation please let me know, as this is my first time implementing something more than a simple bug fix in vscode.

Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen a new document.\r\nSet language mode to JSON.\r\nProvide the following content...\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-03/schema\",\r\n  \"type\":\"array\",\r\n  \"items\": {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`items` is incorrectly highlighted as invalid because it's an object.\r\nThis is incorrect, but is likely because the meta-schema is being parsed not as a draft-3 schema.\r\n\r\nIn draft-3, `type` would accept schemas as well as primitive types as strings.\r\nThis was removed in draft-4.\r\n\r\nGiven that it's not expected many people use draft-3, it may be preferable to not support draft-3 at all, and in stead indicate that draft-3 is not supported.\r\n\r\nThis case can be identified when loading a schema for a JSON document, and detecting that both `$schema` and `id` (not `$id` for draft-3) are `\"http://json-schema.org/draft-03/schema#\"`\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes\r\n\r\n\r\nFYI: I'm one of the core team on the JSON Schema spec

Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a [\"definitions\"](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/structuring.html) member for a JSON schema, and put a subschema there.\r\n2. Attempt to refer to this subschema in `settings.json`.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI'm in a folder called \"json\" with a subfolder called \"schemas\" with the schemas, and a subfolder called \".vscode\" for the `settings.json`.\r\n\r\nHere is the definitions schema I am using:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"$schema\": \"https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/schema\",\r\n  \"type\": \"object\",\r\n  \"definitions\": {\r\n    \"items\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"array\",\r\n      \"items\": {\r\n        \"$ref\": \"items.json#\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"minItems\": 1\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I just make `items.json` into an array and use `\"url\": \"./schemas/items.json\"` works fine, but that isn't very conducive to my current work case. \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo I tried using this:\r\n```\r\n\"schema\": {\r\n\t\"type\": \"array\",\r\n\t\"items\": {\r\n\t  \"$ref\": \"./schemas/items.json\"\r\n\t}\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nGot this error: \"Problems loading reference 'vscode://schemas/custom/schemas/items.json': Request vscode/content failed with message: cannot open vscode://schemas/custom/schemas/items.json. Detail: resource is not available\".\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTried using this:\r\n`\"url\": \"file:///C:/Users/BLATANT-DOXX-RISK/Source/Repos/json/schemas/types.json#/definitions/items\"`\r\n\r\nAnd it just used `types.json`, ignored the definitions part, and looked for nothing but a blank object.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFinally, I tried using this: `\"url\": \"./schemas/types.json#/definitions/items\"`.\r\n\r\nGot this error: \"File not found (c:\\Users\\BLATANT-DOXX-RISK\\Source\\Repos\\json\\schemas\\types.json#\\definitions\\items))\".\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n@aeschli came up a *lot* when looking through Github issues.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nVS
