I use this for both office/personal work.\r\n\r\nI've developed a github app [goodfirstissue](https://github.com/rajatjindal/goodfirstissue) which tweets 'good first issues' via twitter handle [@goodfirstissue](https://twitter.com/goodfirstissue). (ofcourse 100% coding for this project was done on vscode) and I saw a lot of issues in vscode that are marked as `goodfirstissue`.\r\n\r\nI was hoping if you can install the app on vscode repo. It needs only read access to issues/metadata.\r\n\r\nthe targeted audience for twitter account are first time contributors, and to encourage open source contributions.\r\n\r\n## Some details:\r\n\r\n**Permissions this app need:** read permission on issues and metadata.\r\n**Twitter Handle used to tweet:** [@goodfirstissue](https://twitter.com/goodfirstissue)\r\n**Source code of the app/webhook:** https://github.com/rajatjindal/goodfirstissue\r\n**Instructions to install github app**: https://github.com/rajatjindal/goodfirstissue#how-to-install\r\n\r\nThank you for

VSCode Version: all VSCode versions including Insider\r\n- OS Version: macOs 10.14.4 but I suppose its the same on every platform\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOk, lets start with first screen shot. **Notice where I have left my mouse cursor**:\r\n<img width=\"521\" alt=\"Zrzut ekranu 2019-04-07 23 34 30\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29686195/55690290-bac24500-598f-11e9-8cfc-516a04552036.png\">\r\n\r\nLets start typing:\r\n<img width=\"519\" alt=\"Zrzut ekranu 2019-04-07 23 34 50\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29686195/55690292-cb72bb00-598f-11e9-97d6-a6c2e46b1113.png\">\r\nNotice **what** is being highlighted and **where**. \r\nThere are two hightlighted lines. \r\n- First one (with `confirm`) is what will be used if I press `tab` for autocompletion. Also it will be a starting point for keyboard `up` and `down` arrow buttons to navigate manually through the list.\r\n- Second highlighted line (with `constructor`) is where I have left my mouse cursor earlier, before I started typing. \r\n\r\nAdditionally (and this is pretty important and annoying) ONLY mouse cursor have ability to use `list.focusForeground` theme setting in Suggest Widget (thats why `contructor` or more precisly `nstructor` is white). We end up in situation where item that is NOT going to be used for autocomplete has higher VISUAL priority. \r\n(We only have `editorSuggestWidget.selectedBackground` to visually mark an Suggest Item that will be used for autocompletion. There is no `editorSuggestWidget.selectedForeground` to make it pop more.)\r\n\r\nHow (in my opinion) it should work:\r\n1. Mouse cursor should NOT hightlight Suggest Widget items only becouse it was left in that spot. It should highlight an item only if we move the mouse cursor.\r\n2. If mouse cursor is moved it should take the visual priority, **unhightlight** first line (with `confirm` in screenshots above), and highlight only the item under the cursor, although this might lead to some confusion, for example: what if we hover Suggest Item with mouse and press `tab`... So this is something to consider.\r\n3. This is very important: along with `editorSuggestWidget.selectedBackground` there should be `editorSuggestWidget.selectedForeground` setting to achieve higher visual priority for keyboard-related actions (like pressing `tab` button to autocomplete, or `up`/`down` arrow buttons to pick other suggestion) on selected Suggest Item\r\n\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/71877","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/71877/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/71877/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/71877/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/71877","id":430117913,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MzAxMTc5MTM=","number":71877,"title":"SOCKS5

call `vscode.debug.startDebugging` with a dynamically generated DebugConfiguration object. When `vscode.debug.startDebugging` is called, the method can encounter scenarios that produce a modal dialog box. We'd like to have a mode that prevents any dialogs from showing up.\r\n\r\nMotivation\r\n* The dialog contains two buttons: \"Cancel\" and \"Open launch.json\".\r\n  * \"Open launch.json\" is not relevant when calling code is providing a custom DebugConfiguration object. Users are unable to take action on this, which can be confusing as a user.\r\n  * \"Cancel\" sends a message to users that nothing further will happen with their intent to debug. The calling code may wish to perform actions (for example, making the call again, or prompting the user for a next action), and encountering this dialog within a more extended flow could result in a jarring experience.\r\n\r\nPossible approach:\r\n* a option that, when passed into `startDebugging` would throw errors rather than show dialogs. The errors would use a common StartDebugError class to convey error codes & messages to the calling code. Calling code would have the flexibility to handle or surface the errors\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/71725","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/71725/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/71725/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/71725/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/71725","id":429324037,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MjkzMjQwMzc=","number":71725,"title":"Fine grained PATH specification","user":{"login":"bence42","id":49201271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjAxMjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/49201271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bence42","html_url":"https://github.com/bence42","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bence42/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bence42/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bence42/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bence42/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bence42/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bence42/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bence42/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bence42/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bence42/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTgxNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTgxNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2019-04-04T14:51:41Z","updated_at":"2019-04-04T14:52:01Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Issue Type: <b>Feature Request</b>\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nCurrently the PATH can be specified for terminal.integrated.env, but this is used by all tasks and it is not used by the launch configurations. Launch configs use the PATH from system settings.\r\n\r\nAs a result, it is not possible to have have multiple compilers each in a different task. Also it is not possible to leave the Windows path unchanged and still be able to launch the executables or debug them, let alone launch it in various environment or debug them with different debugger versions. Currently these can only be done by setting up various batch scripts that do modify the PATH and do the rest, however debugging does not work this way.\r\n\r\nSo my request is that each process started by VS Code (tasks, launch config) shall have its own PATH config and launch the process using that PATH and only use the current system setting as a fallback.\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code
