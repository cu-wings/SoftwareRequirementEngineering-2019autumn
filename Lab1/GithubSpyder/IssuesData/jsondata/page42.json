Type: <b>Feature Request</b>\r\n\r\nThis issue is about battery life on laptop.\r\n\r\nI used to regard vscode as a light-weight editor.And I found vscode is more powerful than I thought.So I got a lot of extensions and I ran programs on it.\r\n\r\nit's powerful.\r\n\r\n***it's too powerful,sometimes***\r\n\r\nwhat I'm saying is,while using vscode with a lot of extensions,CPU usage is much higher than other pure text editor.   \r\n***So,Maybe a pure reading view is good for people reading code with battery***\r\n\r\nIf you can turn on reading view,extensions for intellisense and some powerful functions will be disabled,leaving the highlighting only,becoming a primitive text editor\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.33.1 (51b0b28134d51361cf996d2f0a1c698247aeabd8,

Download and unzip the [project](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/files/3093084/VSCodeDebug.zip)\r\n (it's the default dotnet angular project setting).\r\n2. Open it with VSCode and restore all packages.\r\n3. Hit CTRL+ALT+F5 and start debugging the client (If not done yet, it will install all node modules, so this could take some time).\r\n4. When the server is running hit CTRL+ALT+F5 again and start debugging the client.\r\n5. In the ClientApp\\src\\app\\home\\home.component.ts is a little method where you can set a breakpoint\r\n6. In the Browser on the starting page is a button which calls the onClick() method. Click the button. --> Despite the breakpoint for the onClick method nothing debug-related happens when you click the button.\r\n7. Stop all running debuggers and switch to Program.cs\r\n8. Remove or comment out the following line `options.Authentication.AllowAnonymous = false;`\r\n9. Repeat Steps 3 - 5\r\n10. When you now click the \"Click me\" button, the debugger for Chrome works as expected.\r\n\r\nThe debugger shipped with Chrome is working, even when the windows authentication is enabled and this should be the behavior for the \"Debugger for Chrome\" extension as well.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/72529","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/72529/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/72529/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/72529/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/72529","id":434611207,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MzQ2MTEyMDc=","number":72529,"title":"Support

Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nThis is easily reproducible using the `tree-view-sample` repo.\r\n\r\n1. Add a key binding for `nodeDependencies.editEntry`\r\n1. Open the package explorer view and click on one of the nodes\r\n1. 🐛 execute the key binding and notice the command fails (while if you click the pencil icon it will work fine)\r\n\r\nWhen the command gets executed from the key binding it isn't getting the proper context.

an idea I had for a small opt-in feature for extensions that use `workspace.applyEdit`.\r\n\r\nVS Code Share already implements a system for \"multiplayer\" code editing, with colored cursors for each user:\r\n\r\n![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/media/vscode-follow-multiple-viewlet.png)\r\n\r\nIf changes applied via `workspace.applyEdit` were animated with a similar cursor/highlight pattern, it would be possible to write more useful formatters that run between document saves.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of the proposed workflow:\r\n\r\n- User is working in a JavaScript file with a formatting rule enforcing semicolons.\r\n- He or she writes a line of code without ending it in a semicolon.\r\n- The user then moves the cursor to a different part of the document, more than 4 lines away.\r\n- A colorful cursor labeled \"ESLint\" briefly appears, types the semicolon, then disappears.\r\n\r\nThe effect would also apply in similar scenarios:\r\n- If a formatter were deleting a section of code, the cursor could highlight it first before removal.\r\n- If the user applied a code action, they'd be able to see the effects of that code action as the cursor bounced through the document.\r\n- There would likely need to be an upper limit to the size an edit is permitted to be, while still being animated by the system. Otherwise, large formatting changes would be overwhelming and possibly impact performance.\r\n\r\nSuch a workflow would have the following benefits:\r\n- \"Inexpensive\" edits, such as adjusting whitespace or adding semicolons, could be applied immediately instead of waiting for the user to save the document. This would reduce the number of squiggly underlines, in turn making it easier for the user to scan their document for the errors and warnings which truly warrant their attention.\r\n- Labeling the cursor with the formatter's name allows the user to understand why a particular edit was applied.\r\n- Waiting for the cursor to move at least 4 lines away ensures that the user never \"fights with\" the formatter. Users would be able to configure this distance to their comfort.\r\n- It would be fun to use and make the application feel more futuristic, almost as if the IDE were a peer instead of a tool 👨🤝🤖 \r\n\r\nThis effect could be faked on a case-by-case basis using decorations, but I think it would be incredible if this were implemented and widely used. This animation would be off by default, but extension authors would be able to opt in with a flag.\r\n\r\nThis is definitely similar to the \"Format On Type\" setting, and could be implemented as a refinement of that."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/72422","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/72422/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/72422/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/72422/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/72422","id":433844335,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MzM4NDQzMzU=","number":72422,"title":"[folding]

Type: <b>Bug(-ish)</b>\r\n\r\nTooltips inside the code editor are really useful, but... Also go away!\r\n\r\nWhen I hover my mouse over something slowly enough in order to find that one spot I need to start typing, a tooltip may show up. I need to be somewhere along the lines I'm looking at. Now a tooltip is obscuring the code I was looking at.\r\n\r\nStill not a huge problem.\r\n\r\nNow I need to be one or two lines above the word where the tooltip showed up for. How do I make the tooltip go away? I click frantically, but in the process I just select the text in the tooltip? Why would I even want that? Go away! Shoo!\r\n\r\nBy now, I forgot what I needed to do.\r\n\r\nTurns out, I need to move my mouse well away from where I need to be, in order to make the tooltip disappear. By then, my eyes are focused nowhere near where I needed to be in my code. I have to re-find that spot, carefully avoiding that tooltip that ripped my out of my flow earlier.\r\n\r\nThis is not happening on a single instance. This happens many times a day.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion:\r\nIt must be easier to do away with the tooltip.\r\nI *don't* want it to bother me.\r\nI *do* want it to be useful to me.\r\n\r\nIn retrospect:\r\nThe story above, of course, happens nothing as slowly as I make it out to be. It happens in a second or so. But that second, every time, takes me out of my concentration. I think we all know how that feels.\r\n\r\nProposed solutions:\r\n* Click the tooltip to make it dissappear.\r\n* Have it be \"click-through\" where clicks on it are actually clicks behind it.\r\n* Have it display away from the mouse cursor's trajectory. Display it above the cursor if moving downward, display below the cursor if moving upward.\r\n* Don't display the helptext as a tooltip at all, but in a fixed position somewhere.\r\n\r\nVS Code

tried as best I could to look for duplicates, but couldn't find any.
