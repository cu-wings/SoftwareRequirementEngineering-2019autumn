This is, because all touch gestures are interpreted as scrolling and not as selecting.\r\n\r\nI looked what Notepad++ does. This is very interesting. Notepad++ works differently depending on what direction the touch swiping starts. If it starts vertically (up/down) then ist is scrolling and if it starte horizontally (left/right) it is selecting. - It should be noted, that even if you start moving the finger up or down for scrolling, if the scrolling has started you still can scroll left or right. If you are in selection mode (left/right movement) you can also select up and down. So the application looks how the movement started. This is a really cool and accassible way of using touch in this program.\r\n\r\nVisual Studio code should work in a similar way.\r\n\r\n(PS: This whole way of using with touch reminds me of the clever way Tiles worked Windows 8. Unfortunately Microsoft forgot about that, when they switched scrolling direction of Tiles in Windows 10.)\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.38.1 (b37e54c98e1a74ba89e03073e5a3761284e3ffb0,
