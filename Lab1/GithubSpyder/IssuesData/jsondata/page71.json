of a latest update, VS Code now does the wrong thing when using the Source Control pane during a `git rebase` command. `git rebase -i` allows the rebase to be stopped in in order to `edit` commits. This includes undoing them, changing the commit message, or adding more commits. Now, instead of just allowing commits as usual, VS Code attempts to use `git rebase --continue` after altering a commit, which fails because there is still a commit pending that is not the original.\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.28.2 (system setup)\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10 Enterprise 1809 17763.55\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new branch, and add at least one commit to the branch.\r\n2. In the terminal, do `git rebase -i master`\r\n3. In the editor for the interactive rebase, change a commit from `pick` to `edit`\r\n4. Close the editor.\r\n5. Git will start the rebase, and stop on the commit. It will prompt to amend the commit or add more.\r\n6. In the Source Control pane, use 'Undo last commit'\r\n7. Once the commit is soft reset, attempt to edit the commit. Rename the commit description or make more local changes.\r\n8. Note that VS Code shows a warning that editing the commit is not allowed, even though Git specifically allows it here.\r\n9. Attempt to commit anyway through the Source Control pane.\r\n10. VS Code pops a dialog from Git, saying that the operation is not allowed.\r\n11. In the Git log, observe that the commit action actually sent `git rebase --continue`, which is not correct. It should have just done a usual `git commit`\r\n\r\nOne can work around the issue by completing the commit in the terminal window, but using VS Code normally handles the work of auto-staging files and deletions, making it a lot more useful.\r\n\r\n![10 26 vs code git rebase edit blocked](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6828233/47572497-f5f41e80-d8ef-11e8-9200-8129e130bc2f.gif)\r\n\r\nThis used to work! If you want to be more helpful during rebases, I suggest adding a dedicated 'continue' button instead of altering the behavior of the commit button.\r\n\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/61867","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/61867/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/61867/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/61867/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/61867","id":374322164,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNzQzMjIxNjQ=","number":61867,"title":"Drag and Drop text (still) copies it instead of moving","user":{"login":"Elkfoot2","id":37156554,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTU2NTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/37156554?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elkfoot2","html_url":"https://github.com/Elkfoot2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elkfoot2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elkfoot2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elkfoot2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elkfoot2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elkfoot2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elkfoot2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elkfoot2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elkfoot2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elkfoot2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129993,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTYxMjk5OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"8D6673","default":true},{"id":759876543,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NTk4NzY1NDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-drag-and-drop","name":"editor-drag-and-drop","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjkyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjkyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-10-26T10:26:41Z","updated_at":"2019-07-29T14:47:34Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I know this is a duplicate of #35453 and #54500, but those were closed and locked because it was considered fixed.

2 years of conversation in issue #10759 (Release in the Windows Store) I think this is the right time to reevaluate the request.\r\n\r\nWhat we originally wanted is all the goodness of UWP lifecycle management (clean install/uninstall and updates received in the background without having to run the app), but now it's possible outside of the Store with MSIX packaging without having to comply with some of the stricter rules of the Store and resource/capability management of UWP apps.\r\n\r\nSo the proposal is simple: **Please make an MSIX installer for VS Code** even if it's not distributed through the Store (for numerous technical reasons).\r\n\r\nAs a first step, Windows 10 users would benefit from it, later, as MSIX is designed to be cross-platform, it can evolve into the only installer format on all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows 7+) and as the Store evolves, it can be a good foundation to potentially publish VS Code to the

vscode community, thanks for your amazing work.\r\n\r\nI ran into issues as I was trying to debug my python code that involves sub arguments.

am using VS Code 1.28.2 on Windows 10. I'm editing an HTML file indented with tabs. But I have HTML `<pre>` sections which I want indented with spaces.\r\n\r\nLet's say I have the following code:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<pre>\r\n  foo //I press <Enter> at the end of this line\r\n</pre>\r\n```\r\n* When I open the file VS Code detects I use tabs. Fine.\r\n* When I hit `<Enter>` at the end of the line that says \"foo\", VS Code indents the next line. Fine.\r\n* VS Code isn't smart enough to realize that I want to indent the next line with spaces instead of a tab, because it already got into its head that I want to use tabs everywhere. It's not smart enough to realize that the previous line `  foo` was indented with spaces. It uses a tab for the next line. But OK, I can live with that, too. It's understandable.\r\n* **Bug:** What isn't acceptable is that VS Code _changes the indention of the existing line_ from spaces to tabs!!\r\n\r\nYes, when I hit `<Enter>` after \"foo\", it not only indents the next line but _changes the indention that comes before `foo`_ from spaces to tabs.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<pre>\r\n  foo //bug: the two spaces have been converted to a tab!\r\n  //this new line also has a tab, which I don't want but can accept for now\r\n</pre>\r\n```\r\n\r\nVS Code has no business of changing the existing line. I simply hit `<Enter>` to go to the next time. This is a huge problem, and it has likely corrupted a bunch of lines in this file because I didn't catch on to what it was doing.\r\n\r\nSure, we have auto-indent features to try to automatically
