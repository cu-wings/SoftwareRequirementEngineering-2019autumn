had an issue raised at https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1516 that seems to be a race condition when tasks are set to `\"runOn\": \"folderOpen\"`. The issue is that the task is invoked before the extension activates resulting in \"The pub task detection didn't contribute a task\" (on Windows, at least - I can repro there, but not on macOS...).\r\n\r\nIn the task provider sample, it activates with `\"onCommand:workbench.action.tasks.runTask\"` which sidesteps this issue by ensuring the extension is activated when *any* task is run.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't make sense for all extensions that have tasks to activate when *any task at all* is run. It's bad for VS Code's performance, and since we [don't have an activation reason](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/44711) we don't know when this happens. VS Code knows the `type` of the commands it's trying to run, and it knows which extensions may be involved (from their manifests).\r\n\r\nIdeally, I think VS Code could activate the extensions it knows may be required when it's executing a command. Otherwise, I think we should at least be able to activate on execution of a specific task type (`onTaskType:foo` for ex)."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/70298","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/70298/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/70298/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/70298/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/70298","id":419874771,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MTk4NzQ3NzE=","number":70298,"title":"Find in selection doesn't work for selection in single line in some cases","user":{"login":"sliwinski-milosz","id":13810205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODEwMjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/13810205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sliwinski-milosz","html_url":"https://github.com/sliwinski-milosz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sliwinski-milosz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sliwinski-milosz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sliwinski-milosz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sliwinski-milosz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sliwinski-milosz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sliwinski-milosz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sliwinski-milosz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sliwinski-milosz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sliwinski-milosz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":398766855,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzOTg3NjY4NTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-find","name":"editor-find","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":578047123,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NzgwNDcxMjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/under-discussion","name":"under-discussion","color":"dcdcdc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjkyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjkyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2019-03-12T09:12:37Z","updated_at":"2019-08-02T00:14:01Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.32.1\r\n- OS Version: macOS High Sierra 10.13.6\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.

a popular request to make better use of vertical screen space.\r\n\r\nFixes #33607\r\n\r\nCurrently, when hiding editor tabs with the action _\"View: Toggle Tab Visibility\"_, tabs are not really hidden but rather replaced with a display panel that seems to have strictly less functionality than tabs. This commit ~~changes the behavior~~ [edit: adds a new option] so that tabs are really hidden and the editor gets more vertical screen space. This has been a popular request (issue #33607).\r\n\r\n~~I may be missing some rationale behind the current behavior. If that's the case then we may be better off introducing an additional configuration option that lets users define the behavior for hiding tabs. However, I'm not sure how to phrase such an option because I don't understand the motivation behind the current behavior.~~\r\n[edit: the proposed new behavior is now behind a new configuration option \"_Workbench > Editor: Show Title Bar_\" that is independent of tab/breadcrumb visibility]\r\n\r\n* Current layout with tabs (this remains unchanged by the proposed commit):\r\n![current-with-tabs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1719283/54080097-99d9d780-429d-11e9-8f92-b5d9e4f8d698.png)\r\n\r\n* Current layout when tabs are hidden [edit: now also unchanged by the new proposal]:\r\n![current-without-tabs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1719283/54080099-a65e3000-429d-11e9-99ce-803cb51a7cc0.png)\r\n\r\n* Proposed new layout ~~when tabs are hidden~~  [edit: when \"_Workbench > Editor: Show Title Bar_\" is set to `false`] as implemented in this commit:\r\n![new-without-tabs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1719283/54080105-c261d180-429d-11e9-9ad9-57320c8e65d3.png)"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/70137","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/70137/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/70137/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/70137/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/70137","id":419123025,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MTkxMjMwMjU=","number":70137,"title":"Allow to disable cursor blinking in input boxes","user":{"login":"georgeabr","id":37941352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTQxMzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/37941352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgeabr","html_url":"https://github.com/georgeabr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgeabr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgeabr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgeabr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgeabr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgeabr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgeabr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgeabr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgeabr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgeabr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":398766855,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzOTg3NjY4NTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-find","name":"editor-find","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":272689392,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODkzOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"dcdcdc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2019-03-09T22:35:56Z","updated_at":"2019-03-11T10:42:51Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Is there an option to disable cursor blinking in edit fields/input boxes?

Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nI have several branches that have another name, or rather path, in the upstream repository, e.g. local branch `foo` pushes to and fetches from branch `path/to/foo` in the upstream repository. But the tracking branch is `upstream/foo`, so the tracking branch path doesn't reflect the upstream branch path.\r\n\r\nWith this setup, the `git.pull` and `git.sync` commands fail with a message \"Git: fatal: couldn't find remote ref foo\".\r\n\r\nStudying the code, I found that the bug is either at extensions/git/src/git.ts, lines 1462 - 1470, https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/c63c97c12848e85769e717209b73110e83c18ef6/extensions/git/src/git.ts#L1462-L1470\r\nor at extensions/git/src/repository.ts, lines 924, 944 and 1006,\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/c63c97c12848e85769e717209b73110e83c18ef6/extensions/git/src/repository.ts#L924\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/c63c97c12848e85769e717209b73110e83c18ef6/extensions/git/src/repository.ts#L944\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/c63c97c12848e85769e717209b73110e83c18ef6/extensions/git/src/repository.ts#L1006\r\n\r\nShould the `name` field in the `upstream` object really be the name of the remote tracking branch? Shouldn't it be the name of the tracked branch on the remote? Or should the `upstream` object contain another field storing the name of the tracked branch on the remote which then should be used at extensions/git/src/repository.ts, lines 924, 944 and 1006?\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.31.1 (1b8e8302e405050205e69b59abb3559592bb9e60, 2019-02-12T02:20:54.427Z)\r\nOS version: Windows_NT x64 10.0.17134\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>System

end.\r\n- Use the mouse and move the window in any direction.\r\n- observe cursor position has moved, sometimes over the top of a character (instead of between characters) and typed characters appear in a different location\r\n\r\nExpected result - \r\n- after moving the window the cursor stays in the same position and typing occures at the cursor location\r\n\r\nNote - this is slightly different than BUG #45539, the cursor is not always off by 1 character\r\n\r\nSystem note - working with a Surface 2017 (2736x1824 ~15\" screen) and a Samsung (2560x1440 ~ 32\" widescreen), may be related to
