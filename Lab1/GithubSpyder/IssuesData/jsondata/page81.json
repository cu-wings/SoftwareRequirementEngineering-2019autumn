Type: <b>Performance Issue</b>\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nSince the last july update and the switch to the user version (vs. all users version) of vscode, everything is slow. Vscode takes like 20 seconds to open and then when I click on a file it takes another 10 seconds to open it.\r\n\r\nI tried to disable all extensions, nothing changed.\r\n\r\nThe problem came right after I downloaded the \"user version\" of vscode. Before that, I had the \"all users version\" installed and everything was ok. Maybe it's because I'm on an entreprise computer linked to a windows domain and our user PATH is special and located on a network drive.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help

I can't afford to lose class time to making students install the Python extension each time they use a new computer or to help troubleshooting students when they have problems.\r\n\r\nI've put together a very hackish workaround where I've created a batch file that installs the plugin and then launches VS Code. I've added shortcuts to this batch file, but it's messy and I fear brittle.\r\n\r\nPlease add a flag to code --install-extension that allows users to specify the extension is to be installed for all

Then, as the user moved the cursor, the selection would be recalculated to span the anchor position and the cursor position (using the rules of the selection mode that was initiated).\r\n\r\nThe key advantage of this model is scalability.  All selection navigation is just normal cursor navigation.  The user doesn't need a parallel set of bindings for [every cursor navigation operation] times [every selection mode], only a hotkey to enter each mode followed by normal cursor navigation.  Writing selection modes is easier too, as it really is just writing the function that calculates the selection area demarcated by a pair of editor positions.\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to program in VSCode but anchor-based selection is an essential requirement for any editor I use.

Start debugging the extension (e.g. with the example from step 2) and try to open a new folder - a new window will be opened with the normal environment _not_ the extension development host\r\n\r\nYou will see that some people struggle with the `\"window.openFoldersInNewWindow\": \"on\"` setting when they start extension development. Extension authors need to explicitly mention that to contributors as a possible problem (see here: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/wiki/Building,-Debugging-and-Sideloading-the-extension-in-Visual-Studio-Code#building-and-debugging-the-extension). It would be nice if the `\"window.openFoldersInNewWindow\": \"on\"` setting could be kept as a user setting, but can be overridden via CLI for extension development. But sadly `--reuse-window` doesn't seem to work here.\r\n\r\n(Side question: Can I override an arbitrary setting via CLI? Something like `--settings \"{ \\\"window.openFoldersInNewWindow\\\": \\\"off\\\" }\"`.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes/No\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nA completely different solution would be to respect the current environment/host, when a new folder is opened so that a new window will be created, but with the extension development host in use. (But I'm not sure if debugging would still work in this case.)"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/56279","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/56279/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/56279/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/56279/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/56279","id":350217285,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNTAyMTcyODU=","number":56279,"title":"Option to specify separator for \"Copy Relative Path\" action","user":{"login":"IllusionMH","id":1312662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTI2NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1312662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IllusionMH","html_url":"https://github.com/IllusionMH","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IllusionMH/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IllusionMH/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IllusionMH/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IllusionMH/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IllusionMH/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IllusionMH/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IllusionMH/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IllusionMH/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IllusionMH/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODkzOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"dcdcdc","default":false},{"id":750865615,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NTA4NjU2MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench-editors","name":"workbench-editors","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMTQxMjEyNA==","number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODcwNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":1680,"closed_issues":5342,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2019-10-14T16:35:16Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":28,"created_at":"2018-08-13T22:32:01Z","updated_at":"2019-10-09T19:59:15Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->\r\nLooked for other mentions but haven't found related requests or discussion.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->\r\nI'm often using Copy Relative Path feature to compose import strings or share with other developers on Mac/Linux.

I believe cramming a bunch of stuff could cause more confusion. The title and subtitle should be placed aligned in the middle, with the VSCode icon (coloured or the non-coloured version, I'm personally split on this and leave it up to you should you consider my suggestion) on top of the text\r\n(maybe text sits on top, overlapping? Again, split).\r\n- Next is what comes under it, I believe this should be the \"Help\" box.\r\n  - Some users may click the links given, some may just want to start coding right away\r\n  - This could show to new users that the editor is very capable, and there is thorough help for anything needed. This could in turn quickly ease them into usage as they would have a definite source of help.\r\n  - This should be its own container, definitely not full-width, but more center aligned like everything else, maybe set margins/padding around the container to present it neatly.*\r\n- Under the \"Help\" container, should be, in my opinion, a new category called \"Files\", which would be a merge of the current \"Start\" and \"Recent\" categories.\r\n  - The layout of this is similar to the \"Help\" I mentioned above, and place the options inside said container and possibly separate them with title and a divider*\r\n- Finally, under those should be the 2 categories would be the \"Customize\" and \"Learn\"\r\n\r\n* In terms of layout, everything is aligned in the middle, with some padding at least on the left and right so everything is more to the center, and easier to read.
