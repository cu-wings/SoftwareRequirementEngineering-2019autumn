Relearning takes more time than making an alias once. This would also allow to use two editors in parallel without interference. Before I came to VSCode I used emacs. I regularly want to call `diff-buffer-with-file` and it takes me some time to figure out that in VSCode it's called `Compare active file with saved`.\r\n- You could define abbreviations that are quicker to type than selecting regular command names with the fuzzy search, e.g. `tt`.  This is quite popular in emacs, see e.g. http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_alias.html \r\n- if you regularly hit keys in the wrong order an alias might be useful for command you regularly use.\r\n\r\nI think I'm not the only one who likes such a feature: When I used emacs I checked quite a few popular user configurations that users keep on github. A lot of these contain aliases by using the command `(defalias ...)` - including popular/influential ones like [spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/), [abo-abo's oremacs](https://github.com/abo-abo/oremacs), the [config of the emacs maintainer](https://github.com/jwiegley/dot-emacs) ... \r\n\r\nThis has been asked on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/vscode/comments/8bj63w/can_i_set_an_alias_for_the_command_palette/) and [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50143258/add-alias-for-commands-in-command-palette) without any useful answer.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/50827","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/50827/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/50827/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/50827/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/50827","id":327857266,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMjc4NTcyNjY=","number":50827,"title":"Workspace setting default value in new Setting Editor is ambiguous","user":{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjkyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":529237263,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MjkyMzcyNjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/settings-editor","name":"settings-editor","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":578047123,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NzgwNDcxMjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/under-discussion","name":"under-discussion","color":"dcdcdc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzg3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzg3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2018-05-30T18:56:13Z","updated_at":"2019-10-08T20:02:21Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"<!--\r\nDo you have a question?

is a big annoyance I've just come to accept in Visual Studio and VS Code and I suspect many other developers have too.

#25786 (Closes #28018)\r\n\r\n## Problem Summary\r\nLike in the above issue, I'm trying to debug TypeScript+AVA tests ([here in typescript-starter](https://github.com/bitjson/typescript-starter/blob/master/.vscode/launch.json#L38)).\r\n\r\nIdeally, I'd like the flow to be as simple as with javascript spec files – navigate to the file, launch the \"Debug Visible Spec\" task. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this would set the`${file}` predefined variable to e.g.:\r\n`absolute/path/to/typescript-starter/src/lib/number.spec.ts`\r\n\r\nBut In order to run the compiled test, I need the path to be transformed into:\r\n`absolute/path/to/typescript-starter/build/main/lib/number.spec.js`\r\n\r\nThis isn't possible given the currently available predefined variables. \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new `${relativePath}`, similar to the existing `${relativeFile}` variable, but which only returns the path to the file. Combined with other predefined variables, this gives us much more flexibility, e.g.: `${workspaceFolder}/${relativePath}/${fileBasenameNoExtension}.js`\r\n\r\nOne non-obvious detail: in many cases, projects need to be able to reference a path which is relative to a folder **inside** `${workspaceFolder}`, so without further configurability, `${relativePath}` doesn't help. (This is the case for most of the commenters in #25786.) \r\n\r\nSo in addition to the standard [workspace scope argument](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/variables-reference#_variables-scoped-per-workspace-folder), `${relativePath}` accepts a second argument – the path from which the relative path is calculated. This lets us solve all the use cases in the linked issue. For example, this string gives us the transformation needed in the first example:\r\n\r\n`${workspaceFolder}/build/main/${relativePath:typescript-starter:src}/${fileBasenameNoExtension}.js`\r\n\r\nIf the second argument is omitted, the path is simply calculated relative to `${workspaceFolder}`.\r\n\r\nDocumentation PR: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docs/pull/1649"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/50750","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/50750/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/50750/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/50750/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/50750","id":327507589,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMjc1MDc1ODk=","number":50750,"title":"Find/replace: Keyboard shortcuts for \"toggleFindCaseSensitive\" and \"toggleFindRegex\" don't work when find has focus","user":{"login":"shawnheide","id":7305354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDUzNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7305354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawnheide","html_url":"https://github.com/shawnheide","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawnheide/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawnheide/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawnheide/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawnheide/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawnheide/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawnheide/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawnheide/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawnheide/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawnheide/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":398766855,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzOTg3NjY4NTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-find","name":"editor-find","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":578047123,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NzgwNDcxMjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/under-discussion","name":"under-discussion","color":"dcdcdc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjkyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjkyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-05-29T22:19:35Z","updated_at":"2018-09-18T23:19:14Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\nDo you have a question?

With focus in Find widget, press (Alt+Command+R) for `toggleFindRegex` or (Alt+Command+C) for `toggleFindCaseSensitivity`\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes/No\r\nYes\r\n\r\nThe commands seem to be overridden by `revealFileInOS` (regex) and `copyFilePath` (case sensitivity) since they have the same keybindings with the context `!editorTextFocus`. However, the commands for `toggleFindInSelection` (Alt+Command+L) and `toggleFindWholeWord` (Alt+Command+W) seem to work since they don't have any commands with the same bindings."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/50697","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/50697/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/50697/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/50697/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/50697","id":327410103,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMjc0MTAxMDM=","number":50697,"title":"Settings: Color Picker","user":{"login":"octref","id":4033249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzMyNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4033249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/octref","html_url":"https://github.com/octref","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/octref/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/octref/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/octref/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/octref/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/octref/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/octref/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/octref/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/octref/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/octref/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODkzOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"dcdcdc","default":false},{"id":529237263,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MjkyMzcyNjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/settings-editor","name":"settings-editor","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzg3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzg3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-05-29T17:06:06Z","updated_at":"2018-05-29T17:10:34Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"#50496\r\n\r\nThe ability to pick colors easily is lost in the GUI.
