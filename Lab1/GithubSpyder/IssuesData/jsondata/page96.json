Type: <b>Feature Request</b>\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to executing `Tasks: Run [Build] Tasks`, instead of putting the message, `Fetching [build] tasks...` in the status bar (where I often don't notice it) and waiting for all tasks to be available before showing anything, I would like the dialog to pop up immediately, with that message at the top, and populate as tasks are found.\r\n\r\nAs a rough example (please pardon my [lack of] ms paint skills):\r\n\r\n![vscode issue 47449](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/879055/38473412-89788370-3b44-11e8-8d53-2ee1101b409c.png)\r\n\r\nWhen I execute `Tasks: Run Build Task` just after opening VSCode, or after VSCode has been inactive for quite a while, the `Fetching build tasks...` job takes a fair bit of time to complete. It completes slightly faster for a single-root workspace than for a multi-root workspace, but it still take an annoyingly long time to complete.\r\n\r\nI would guess that tasks from `tasks.json` do not take very long to fetch, and the main holdup is waiting for tasks from extensions and from gulp. Since I often want to run a task from `tasks.json`, it would be wonderful to not have to wait for all of the other tasks to populate before I can run one of those.\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.22.1

Test the keybinding with various selections and non-selections\r\n\r\nNotice that if you use the UI to assign the keybinding, then the \"plain\" and \"chord + plain\" examples will trigger the UI context menu (so you will need to press [Esc] and [Enter] to confirm the keybinding) but the \"modifier\" and \"chord + modifier\" examples will not.\r\n\r\nWhen the [ContextMenu] key is used unmodified (as in the \"plain\" and \"chord + plain\" examples above), then:\r\n- when editor text has focus: *does not* trigger `action` + triggers UI context menu\r\n- outside editor: triggers `action` + triggers UI context menu\r\n\r\nWhen the [ContextMenu] key is used modified (as in the \"modifier\" and \"chord + modifier\" examples above), then:\r\n- when editor text has focus: *does not* trigger `action` + triggers UI context menu\r\n- outside editor, with selection: triggers `action` + triggers UI context menu\r\n- outside editor, without selection: triggers `action` + *does not* trigger UI context menu\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/47394","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/47394/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/47394/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/47394/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/47394","id":312212936,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMTIyMTI5MzY=","number":47394,"title":"Unable to scroll when viewing extremely large files","user":{"login":"Zinfour","id":30809212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODA5MjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/30809212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zinfour","html_url":"https://github.com/Zinfour","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zinfour/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zinfour/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zinfour/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zinfour/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zinfour/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zinfour/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zinfour/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zinfour/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zinfour/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":815443654,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MTU0NDM2NTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-textbuffer","name":"editor-textbuffer","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":578047123,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NzgwNDcxMjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/under-discussion","name":"under-discussion","color":"dcdcdc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjkyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjkyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-04-07T14:45:53Z","updated_at":"2018-09-18T23:19:05Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

Use this tasks.json (check if the project path fits you first)\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\r\n    \"command\": \"tsc\",\r\n    \"isShellCommand\": true,\r\n    \"args\": [\r\n        \"-w\",\r\n        \"-p\",\r\n        \".\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"showOutput\": \"silent\",\r\n    \"isBackground\": true,\r\n    \"problemMatcher\": {\r\n        \"base\": \"$tsc-watch\",\r\n        // \"owner\": \"typescript\",\r\n        //  \"applyTo\": \"allDocuments\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. Start the task\r\n3. Errors will show in error list (hopefully, if there are errors at all)\r\n4. Randomly click between errors of different files in error list. The files will open and close automatically (if they are not pinned). When a file closes, it's errors disappear!\r\n\r\nWhat I have tried:\r\n- $tsc-watch matcher without any other options\r\n- owner property \"typescript\" or something artificial\r\n- applyTo property all possibilities\r\n- in settings: typescript.validate.enable === false\r\n\r\nThe \"best\" in my trial and error endevour I have got was that the errors just persisted, even when fixed, lol :)\r\n\r\nMy user settings (don't have workspace settings)\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"terminal.integrated.shell.windows\": \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\cmd.exe\",\r\n    \"editor.wordWrap\": \"on\",\r\n    \"explorer.confirmDelete\": false,\r\n    \"editor.quickSuggestions\": {\r\n        \"other\": false,\r\n        \"comments\": false,\r\n        \"strings\": false\r\n    },\r\n    \"editor.autoClosingBrackets\": false,\r\n    \"explorer.confirmDragAndDrop\": false,\r\n    \"editor.acceptSuggestionOnCommitCharacter\": false,\r\n    \"window.zoomLevel\": 0,\r\n

a feature request for the editor:\r\n\r\nProposal is to make the indents non-editable.\r\n(add such edit mode)\r\n\r\nHow it works: \r\n- indent char is specified globally in a setup (i.e. \\t or space*n)\r\n- those become non-editable, i.e you cannot input anything before \r\nor inside an indent.\r\n- pressing TAB/SHIFT-TAB indents selected lines more/less\r\n\r\nHow selection works:\r\n- dragging the mouse highlights text starting \r\nfrom the least indented line in the selection\r\n- copy-pasting the selection copies it as if the selected block \r\nwas on zero-indent, thus no need to reformat after pasting -\r\nit will just add indent from the target line (where caret is at pasting)\r\n\r\nFor pasting from the buffer with unknown preceding whitespace -\r\nadd some optional pasting, i.e. char sequences that are parsed as indents.\r\n\r\nIdeally, this should affect the **memory representation** also - \r\ni.e. retrieving the text of line X should give string **without** indent characters,\r\nand give access to additional indent value. \r\nWhy? because IMO this makes much more sense for scripting.\r\n\r\nHope this is clear.\r\nSuch feature will significantly reduce finger movements \r\nand will make editing and scripting more robust.\r\nFurther, the non-editable indent space area on the screen can be utilized for \r\nsome mouse click actions - e.g. line selection.\r\n\r\n**Demos**\r\n\r\n**Caret movements** - walks only in text, remembers position in text:\r\n\r\n![caret](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12515548/38472866-16b2a820-3b8f-11e8-921b-32fe5011695b.gif)\r\n\r\n**Selection**: do NOT select the indents,  but grabs them only locally - i.e. starting \r\nfrom the _least indented line in current selection_ \r\n(blue bullets - the indents that will be selected and copied):\r\n\r\n![selection](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12515548/38472894-7806a9fa-3b8f-11e8-98f5-b949a5a40dc8.gif)\r\n\r\n**Copy-pasting**: when pasting, adds the current line's indent to each of the buffer's line, \r\nwhich results in precisely formatted lines:\r\n\r\n![copy-paste](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12515548/38472937-0c935370-3b90-11e8-8135-1855e84471fb.gif)\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/47354","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/47354/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/47354/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/47354/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/47354","id":312105173,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMTIxMDUxNzM=","number":47354,"title":"Buttons

VSCode each file is associated with a language. Language supports such as code completion, hovers, are contributed to that language. This is ideally through a language server.\r\nWhen a language allows to embedded snippets of an other language (e.g. CSS in HTML or HTML in PHP) there are various techniques that a language server can use:\r\n\r\n- The language server also implements support for the embedded language. It can do that by including libraries that provide that support. For example there are easy to use node modules for [css, less, scss](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-css-languageservice), [html](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-html-languageservice) and [json](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-json-languageservice) or more basic language supports for [typescript](https://github.com/Microsoft/typescript)\r\n- Forward requests to an other language server as done in [intelephense](https://github.com/bmewburn/vscode-intelephense)\r\n\r\nThe first approach has the following advantages\r\n- Full control of the user experience. Completion proposals, hovers... can be tuned to apply to the situation.\r\n- No dependencies on other language servers, self contained server that is easy to embedded also in other editors or IDE.\r\n\r\nIn either case the embedded content needs to be escaped according to the owner language.

I am not sure about this but I don't think collecting telemtry data by default will conform to the General Data Protection Regulation of the EU that becomes effective in May 2018. It would be better to disable it per default and tell the user to enable it if he want's to share data with you.\r\n\r\n2. When I checked the privacy policy linked in the notification popup (https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement) I can't find anything about the data collected by vs code.

Windows, when running tests, `process.cwd()` is the location of VS Code, whereas on macOS it's the extension root folder.\r\n\r\nThis means relative paths in tests are resolved different; for example the sample code at https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-debugadapter-node/tree/master/testSupport is relative and fails on Windows (and to make things worse, debugging DebugClient is really frustrating, as it doesn't seem to expose errors or the data going over the protocol easily, and for some reason breakpoints don't seem to work unless they were added in the very same debug session!).\r\n\r\nI know things shouldn't really rely on `cwd`, but it's somewhat convenient in tests to not have to join everything so it'd be good if these behaved the

like to add a command for \"Run in Profile Mode\" however it should respect the users current debug settings in `launch.json` (and which debug config the have selected in the debug tab), similar to pressing F5.\r\n\r\nWhile the user can add `mode: profile` to the launch.json, it means they'd have to maintain the launch config duplicated and wouldn't be able to key-bind this setting.\r\n\r\nCould we have (if there isn't already) a way to start a debug session similar to the user hitting `F5` (currently the startDebug API requires a name/config and doesn't seem to support just using the same thing that F5 would) but that allows some arbitrary config to be passed in (eg. `mode: profile`)?"}]
