think it is a key feature of many of the pickers we have in VS Code that the list filters based on the input text. It would make sense to apply that to the simple file picker and maybe have a setting to switch between the more OS file picker-like behavior and the VS Code picker-like behavior.\r\n\r\nFrom looking at how it currently works: The filtering would have to be done based on only the last segment of the path in the filter text box, which will require an addition on the QuickInput side.\r\n\r\nBackground: I find tab completion in zsh more powerful (and useful) than in bash because it not only matches on prefixes, but on all parts of the

a debug session can be restarted in many ways. Most of those are initiated by the user, but there are some when we do this automatically due to an event from the debug adapter extension.\r\nIn those cases the user may be surprised as to what is going on, and might not get the full picture.\r\nIn order to improve that I suggest to somehow notify the user, here are some ideas:\r\n* Show a notification message that automatically goes away\r\n* Do a decoration in the call stack view on a debug session (when there are sessions shown, or in the call stack title)\r\n\r\nWe can also try to tackle this issue from an EH debugging perspective only.

Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nWhen poping a stash and there are merge conflicts between the stash and current code, even after the conflict is resolved, the pop'ed stash isn't dropped from the stash list.\r\nThe only way to drop a stash in vscode, AFAIK, is by successfully merging a stash, meaning that if a stash is no longer relevant (only conflicts, never merged), it can never be dropped from within vscode, only by a terminal command.\r\n\r\nmy suggestion is: when there are conflicts, let the user choose whether to resolve the conflicts or to just drop the stash.\r\n\r\nVS Code version:

Click a keyword at the top, you know is also down the middle of the file. Dot's in the scrollbar should point to the found keywords. Enlarge the \"output\" area to fill more than half the screen height. If you now click one of the last/lowest dots in the scrollbar, the file should scroll down to the keyword is visible, but you will most likely find, that the keyword is still hidden behind the output area. Thus the scrollbar does not adjust to the visible area of the editor.\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.35.1 (c7d83e57cd18f18026a8162d042843bda1bcf21f, 2019-06-12T14:30:02.622Z)\r\nOS version: Windows_NT

snippets already support being scoped by language and language file snippets are naturally scoped.  I would like to expand that \"scoping\" logic to specific files by matching the filename, for example.\r\n\r\nA good use case for this, let's say I want to create snippets for travis.yml file. Right now what I do is to create the snippet scoped to YAML language. \r\n\r\nThe problem is that it will appear for every YAML file which will pollute the autocomplete with not very useful results if you have snippets for multiple kinds of files that have the same extension. (I don't want to see \"travis\"  related snippets in a \"gitlab-ci.yml\" file for example) as they are not applicable.\r\n\r\nI think this is most critical for configuration files where they have a very specific scope and that you can easily restrict by looking at the filename.\r\n\r\nGoing further, we could even expand this concept for other kinds of snippets. For example, I can have some project level snippets for building queries and I only want to enable them, in Repository classes and not in Controller classes. You could scope the files it applies using a regex pattern, for example.\r\n\r\nI guess this shouldn't be very hard to do and it would vastly improve the suggestions quality of the snippets.\r\n\r\nI see adding a new field similar to \"scope\" called \"context\" or something where you can specify a regex that will match to the filename.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75938","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75938/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75938/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75938/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/75938","id":459470753,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NTk0NzA3NTM=","number":75938,"title":"Diff
