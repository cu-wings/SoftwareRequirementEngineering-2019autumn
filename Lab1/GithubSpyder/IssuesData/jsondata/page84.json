PR is to implement [54759](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/54749)\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n* Added an attribute to autoClosingPairs hash called \"onlyIn\". It's an array that takes 3 values: \"string\", \"comment\", or \"regex\", and ensures that the autoClosingPair ONLY works within that scope. (Necessary for getting string interpolation to work).  \r\n* Added another attribute to autoClosingPairs hash called \"cursorPosition\". Allows the user to input a position where they want the cursor to be moved to after autocomplete is done. The value must be within the range of 0 and close.length. Else, the cursor will default to the original behavior (cursor located just before the \"close\" string). This helps to move the cursor inside the brackets after the brackets are autocompleted for interpolation.\r\n* Added definitions and functions to other files to ensure that the above attributes are accessible/usable.\r\n* Added tests to test the above implementations.\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/54746","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/54746/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/54746/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/54746/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/54746","id":343164770,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNDMxNjQ3NzA=","number":54746,"title":"VS

Problem\r\nIt is difficult to modify large files (more than 10k lines) efficiently, as we are limited in cursors, as showed in the following gif.\r\n\r\n![Cursor](https://i.imgur.com/fc78CRp.gif)\r\n\r\nWhile i do understand the possible problem to have more than 10k active cursors at the same time, i still think it would be nice to be able to edit large file.\r\n\r\n### Solution and request \r\nI think emacs has a interesting solution for file editing without using multiple cursors: the [rectangle commands](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Rectangles.html).\r\nMaybe using this \"marking\" solution could enable vscode to modify larger file.\r\nThanks.

number one annoyance I have and hear from people about VS Code + TypeScript is that type errors are hard to read.

This would mean the indentation would actually have the intended visual effect.\r\n- Make the width of the hover configurable. I have way more space on my screen it could utilize.\r\n- Add smart wrapping that preserves indentation.\r\n- Add markdown support to diagnostics and make TypeScript output markdown. This would mean not the whole diagnostic has to be rendered in a monospace font, therefor saving horizontal space. The parts that are code would use backticks instead of single quotes."}]
