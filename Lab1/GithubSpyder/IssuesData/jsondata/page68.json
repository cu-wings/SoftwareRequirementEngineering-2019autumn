is a very similar issue to #44200/#57093 but that fix appears to be only being applied to completions, but applying snippets causes the same issues.\r\n\r\nHere's a repro:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nvs.workspace.openTextDocument(vs.Uri.parse(`untitled:${os.tmpdir}/a.dart`)).then(async (document) => {\r\n\r\n\tconst originalCode = `main() {\r\n  // code indented with two spaces\r\n}`;\r\n\tconst editor = await vs.window.showTextDocument(document);\r\n\tawait editor.edit((eb) => eb.insert(new vs.Position(0, 0), originalCode));\r\n\r\n\tconst startOffset = originalCode.indexOf(\"// code indented with two spaces\");\r\n\tconst endOffset = originalCode.indexOf(\"\\n}\");\r\n\tconst snippetString = new vs.SnippetString(\"// new code indented with two spaces\\n  // newer code indented with two spaces\");\r\n\r\n\tawait editor.insertSnippet(snippetString, new vs.Range(document.positionAt(startOffset), document.positionAt(endOffset)));\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis creates a doc and inserts into it the code:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nmain() {\r\n  // code indented with two spaces\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt then applies a snippet string that includes an additional line that is also indented by two spaces. However what you end up with is:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nmain() {\r\n  // new code indented with two spaces\r\n    // newer code indented with two spaces\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe inserted line has been re-indented.\r\n\r\nWhilst this behaviour may be useful if applying basic hard-coded strings, it's incorrect for language servers that are correctly calculating edits to leave the file indented/formatted correctly (I guess for the same reasons that left to #57093)."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/63097","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/63097/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/63097/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/63097/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/63097","id":380565269,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzODA1NjUyNjk=","number":63097,"title":"language aware auto indent","user":{"login":"mityukov","id":1751910,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTE5MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1751910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mityukov","html_url":"https://github.com/mityukov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mityukov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mityukov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mityukov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mityukov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mityukov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mityukov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mityukov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mityukov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mityukov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODkzOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"dcdcdc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjkyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjkyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-11-14T07:13:53Z","updated_at":"2019-08-02T19:46:14Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nThere are couple of examples, one in PHP, another one in JS:\r\n```\r\n// PHP code:\r\n\r\n    DB::table('my_table')\r\n        ->select([ 'my_field' ])\r\n        ->where('type', 'plain')\r\n        ->get();***cursor is here***\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n// JS code:\r\n\r\n    $('.my-button')\r\n        .on('click', () => alert('Clicked');***cursor is here***\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn both cases, pressing Enter would make new line indented just like the previous one (col 8).

snippets with prefixes set become rather useless when they contain the selected text variable.\r\n\r\nI have a snippet like this:\r\n```\r\n  \"lint_checking\": {\r\n    \"prefix\": \"lin\",\r\n    \"body\": [\r\n      \"//lint_checking ${1:RULE_ID} off\",\r\n      \"$TM_SELECTED_TEXT\",\r\n      \"//lint_checking ${1:RULE_ID} on\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"description\": \"lint pragmas\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nWhat I want is being able to select text, start typing lin (which will of course remove the selection) and then IntelliSense will recommend lin as a completion. When I press enter I want the selection to reappear, surrounded by my snippet.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is actually standard in other editors and I was kind of surprised to find no useful way to use snippets with a completion prefix when the selction variable is being used.\r\n\r\nIf this is unwanted by some users this should be made configurable as an option, but as a hardware developer I find myself in the situation quite often where this would be useful, as such 'surrounding pragmas' are pretty common.\r\n\r\nAnother variant would be to make snippets able to be promoted to commands for the Ctrl+Shift+P command palette, so we don't have to go into the insert snippet sub palette. I do not want to assign dedicated Key Bindings, as it just becomes to much. The prefix 'is the keybinding'.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/62903","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/62903/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/62903/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/62903/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/62903","id":379464004,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNzk0NjQwMDQ=","number":62903,"title":"Duplicated

could be a nice feature to show the git progress details in the GIT output console or since Visual Studio even though is 'Code' has the characteristic to being 'Visual', polish the user interface with some indicator. \r\nIn the following images there are some suggestions:\r\n![progress 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8238828/48170162-9c7bee80-e2f6-11e8-830f-7c440c1ef7b2.png)\r\n![progress2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8238828/48170168-a30a6600-e2f6-11e8-807c-817580ac5e84.png)\r\n\r\n**Use case**\r\nIt happen sometime that users have in their own repository some huge files or maybe the connection slow down during the 'git push', users don't have any idea what is happening or what is the current operation state (it could take even plenty of minutes).\r\nIn the example I'have done, this is what is showed actually in VS Code:\r\n![nothappen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8238828/48170294-2b890680-e2f7-11e8-9737-4397bc03bb06.png)\r\nAnd this is what it can be read from the git executable output:\r\n![expected](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8238828/48170317-4c515c00-e2f7-11e8-9903-c5816dcc2084.png)\r\n\r\n**Advantages**\r\nUsers that have this kind of experience can think that the git integration (that is already amazing in VS Code) is not working very good because the operations appears 'blocked'. So they give up and jump on the CLI for the daily usage of git. With some nice improvements like I showed they wouldn't do it.\r\n\r\n**Technical inspection**\r\nI inspected the main source code file about the default GIT extension:\r\n[https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/extensions/git/src/git.ts](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/extensions/git/src/git.ts)\r\nA nice implementation could be extract more information on the 'git commands output' parsing, ex. Operation 'N' of 'M' and 'Percentage', expose it and use on higher layer of Visual Studio Code.\r\n\r\nWaiting for a your feedback.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/62748","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/62748/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/62748/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/62748/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/62748","id":378519012,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNzg1MTkwMTI=","number":62748,"title":"Inconsistent TSX indent cursor after end tag","user":{"login":"dennisss","id":1341104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDExMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1341104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennisss","html_url":"https://github.com/dennisss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennisss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennisss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennisss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennisss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennisss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennisss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennisss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennisss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennisss/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129993,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTYxMjk5OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"8D6673","default":true},{"id":577463440,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1Nzc0NjM0NDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-autoindent","name":"editor-autoindent","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODIxOTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODIxOTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-11-07T23:50:35Z","updated_at":"2018-12-13T20:03:00Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->\r\n<!-- Also please test using the latest insiders build to make sure your issue has not already been fixed: https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/ -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Use Help > Report Issue to prefill these. -->\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.29.0-insider\r\n- OS Version: macOS 10.13.4\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
