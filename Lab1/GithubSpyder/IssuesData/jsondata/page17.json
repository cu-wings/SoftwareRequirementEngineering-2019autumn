They all seem to come back to a focus on known markers, whether file extensions, first lines or a similar premble, or the value of a schema spec. Ref other topics #10915, #11838, #13782, #73424, #53350, #69868. All of these discussions include the notion of an open API that allows an extension to determine the language for a file. But they all seem to conclude with a focus on specific languages, whether JS, JSON, PHP, or XML implementations, and the idea that new options will need to conform to existing processes.\r\n\r\nI'm a member of a non-relational DBMS industry that's been around for over 50 years, using several dialects of the original Dartmouth BASIC. Developers in this industry are slowly adopting VSCode for maintaining code and other documents and features of the environment. Pre-dating DOS and Unix, we have never required extensions on filenames. The first line of a program can be any valid statement, so using line 1 as a marker isn't valid either.\r\n\r\nI recommend merging all of the related repo issues and resolving them with a single, simple change:\r\n1) Run the routine that processes file.associations, as usual.\r\n2) Invoke a new hook which gives a registered extension an opportunity to reset the determined language. Might we be talking about a single line of code in the VSCode core?\r\n3) Then continue as normal to invoke the module that's registered to handle the language.\r\n\r\nThe extension chosen by the user will be FOSS, maintained, installed, and replaced like any other. No one will own the process for language mode selection anymore, and all of these discussions about new ways to choose the language mode go away.\r\n\r\nLike editor.defaultFormatter, there can only be one of these extensions registered. For users with a need for multiple extensions that determine the language mode (last one wins), a mechanism can be designed in the field to allow a cascade of handling, similar to the way linters process sets of rules. Or one extension might attempt to handle all such logic. Again, this is a detail to be shaken out in the field.\r\n\r\nIf required, I'll get into the code and attempt to submit a PR, but since others here are already familiar with this code, and since this one change will resolve a number of issues, I'm hoping that won't be necessary. :)\r\n\r\nIn summary, please don't hardcode rules as a way of providing more freedom to specific groups. We've all recognized the pattern in the referenced requests, and the proposals so far just defer the problem until a new request comes in. The solution to accommodating a wide variety of requests is to call out to external, user-provided functions that make choices which aren't possible with a general-purpose tool.

Start with a vanilla installation of VS Code (delete `~/.config/Code` and `~/.vscode`).\r\n2. As a minimal working example, download the Minimal Hello World Sample extension from https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/helloworld-minimal-sample to `~/.vscode/extensions/helloworld-minimal-sample`.\r\n3. Replace the `onCommand:extension.helloWorld` activation event in `~/.vscode/extensions/helloworld-minimal-sample/package.json` with `onLanguage:plaintext`.\r\n4. Start VS Code via `code`. The Welcome screen opens (and no other files).\r\n5. Select View -> Output -> Log (Extension Host).\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior:\r\nThe log contains the line\r\n```\r\n[2019-09-03 16:44:58.410] [exthost] [info] ExtensionService#_doActivateExtension vscode-samples.helloworld-minimal-sample {\"startup\":false,\"activationEvent\":\"onLanguage:plaintext\"}\r\n```\r\ni.e., the Minimal Hello World Sample extension is activated.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior:\r\nThe extension is not activated, since no plaintext files are open.\r\n\r\n## Additional comments:\r\n* Even if the Welcome screen is closed, a `*.cpp` file is opened, VS Code is reloaded again, VS Code still activates the extension. If all tabs are closed and VS Code is reloaded, the extension doesn't get activated. However, when then opening a `*.cpp` file, the extension will be activated again. It almost seems like when opening, the Welcome screen and every file (regardless which file type) is briefly treated as plaintext before being switched to the correct language.\r\n* Probably related to #28732 and #61825.\r\n\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.37.1 (f06011ac164ae4dc8e753a3fe7f9549844d15e35, 2019-08-15T16:17:25.463Z)\r\nOS version: Linux x64

Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nI opened a .txt file with VSCode on Windows 10 x64 and Yet again VS Code started up with \"Extension host terminated\" occurring within seconds of launching it, even when just using VSCode to open a text file. And this occurs randomly, even when trying the same test file. And occurs with failed logging of the errors and with many different extensions, including official ones, which seems to be the cause in different cases, seeming to indicate core VSCode or Extension Host issues more than extension-specific issues.\r\n\r\n## \"Extension host terminated\" Screenshot\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4053734/64069880-b4678a80-cc08-11e9-949e-c369560fa593.png)\r\n\r\n## Related Issue Detailing Trend of Increasing number of Extension host termination errors across many extensions\r\n\r\nSee #79782 for more details and overview of series of related bug reports, regarding this being a common issue that keeps reoccurring for many popular extensions and how it is impossible to determine which extension caused it and how the crash error itself and the error that caused it or even the extension activation that caused it, it seems, are failing to get logged, as occurred in this case as well.\r\n\r\nI submitted this crash report to provide more details, log files and the like to use as a key test case for debugging and fixing the widespread VSCode issue which I'd described in #79782.\r\n\r\n## Failed Logging and Crash Timing\r\n\r\nThe crash occurred within seconds or less than 1 minute of launching, so around 3:06 PDT 8/31/2019.\r\n\r\nI waited until around 3:12 PM to perform \"Show Developer Tools\".\r\nI expanded all items in the Developer Tools with all levels shown and then saved the log file. Only in that log file does \"terminated\" or \"onExtensionHostCrashed\" show up. No were under any log file under any folder under C:\\Users\\Dan\\AppData\\Roaming\\Code\\logs\\ does either of those words occur when searching all files there. \r\nIn fact, no errors of any kind (which occur only during Extension Host Crash sessions) show up in any of the log files for any of the folders created under that path.\r\n\r\nThis occurred again, 6 days later, after my last related bug report regarding this, despite having disabled other extensions known to cause such issues. Due to lack of error messages getting logged, or even it seems the related extension activation getting logged in time when the host crashes, combined with the fact that I have hundreds of extensions enabled and that this crash does not occur every time I startup VSCode, means that it is impossible to determine which extension caused it.\r\n\r\nIt seems like this may relate to a timing or extension update/activation/interdependency issue, as detailed in #79782, which needs to be addressed in code VSCode or Extension Host code instead of being any specific extension or something that can be fixed or worked around reliably by any extension. Even core Microsoft official extensions like Live Share Audio are aware but have mentioned they are unable to fix any time soon and others who are aware of it and have fixed it but keep having the issue reoccur despite this temporary workarounds. And there are 800+ bug reports across various extensions regarding this issue, recently, as all detailed in  #79782.\r\n\r\n## Errors in Developer Tools\r\n\r\nThese errors are only shown in Developer Tools. No time stamps. And they do not appear on any of the log files on disk, as detailed above. Also, the issue reporter was unable to gather/submit this.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4053734/64069787-04911d80-cc06-11e9-8bb7-fc8262b025e8.png)\r\n\r\n## Developer Tools Saved Log File\r\n\r\n\r\nThough the log folder doesn't show the error, I saved this log file from Developer Tools (after I enabled all Log Levels, manually expanded each log entry, and then saved to file) which at least shows the crash error (only place shown, not logged to disk anywhere, and only shown if show Dev Tools or Restart Extension Host I believe), plus associated zipped log folder (which fails to include that or any other error related to the crash it seems).\r\n\r\n- [ExtensionHostCrash-SavedFromDevTools-1567289793429.log](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/files/3562908/ExtensionHostCrash-SavedFromDevTools-1567289793429.log)\r\n\r\n- [20190831T150524-crashed-again.zip](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/files/3562911/20190831T150524-crashed-again.zip)\r\n\r\n- Same Log Folder after Opening Dev Tools and Closing VSCode (to see if error logging is getting delayed after DevTools is shown)\r\n  - [20190831T150524-after-opened-devtools-closed-vscode.zip](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/files/3562912/20190831T150524-after-opened-devtools-closed-vscode.zip)\r\n\r\n## Non-Crash Logs for Comparison\r\n\r\nFor comparison as a control case, here is a log file I had saved from Dev Tools (also after expanding all items, with all log levels enabled) and the associated zipped log folder, created during a session right after the crash.\r\n\r\n- [StartupOK-AfterCrash-SameFileOpened-FromDevTools-1567292042652.log](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/files/3562913/StartupOK-AfterCrash-SameFileOpened-FromDevTools-1567292042652.log)\r\n\r\n- [20190831T155210-no-crash-right-after.zip](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/files/3562920/20190831T155210-no-crash-right-after.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor that 2nd case, I had launched VSCode the same way (opening the same .txt file) and waited a minute for all extensions to load, which happened fine, without any crash. This shows how this may be some kind of timing related or seemingly randomly occurring issue with the Extension Host, not something that reliably occurs due to one broken extension.  Also, due to failed logging issues, this may help you to identify what extension might have caused the crash by what extension activations, etc. occurred after logging had stopped during the crash case.\r\n\r\n- [20190831T155210-no-crash-right-after.zip](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/files/3562914/20190831T155210-no-crash-right-after.zip)\r\n\r\nThe below zipped log folder is from a session about 1 hour prior to the one where the crash had occurred. This may help identify if there is some issue related to leftover/deferred to next startup/incomplete extension updating for example, considering what seemed to be some of that occurring in the log files.\r\n\r\n- [20190831T134447-no-crash-right-before.zip](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/files/3562916/20190831T134447-no-crash-right-before.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Many Empty Log Folders Being Created and Left Over\r\n\r\nStrangely, like shown in the below screenshot of File Explorer, there were 6 empty log folders (which keep getting created and never cleaned up) which were created before I closed VSCode since the log folder first created on VSCode startup for this crash session. \r\n\r\nYou might want to also consider fixing that as well. With auto-cleanup or preventing those empty log folders from being created in the first place, as they make it hard to find the needed log files. Also, they might indicate some other issue with logging failing to occur.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4053734/64069802-deb84880-cc06-11e9-8996-38ccad444a70.png)\r\n\r\n##

PR adds an option to the Git extension, `handleUntracked`, which changes how it handles untracked files. The options are:\r\n\r\n- `withchanges`: Untracked files are displayed with other changed files. My intention is that should not affect VSCode's current behavior\r\n- `separate`: Untracked files are in a separate `UNTRACKED` section below the `CHANGES` section. When staging all changes, a dialog will ask the user if they want to include untracked files or not.\r\n- `hide`: Untracked files are completely hidden from the changes list. They are also not counted in the badge (even if `all` is selected)\r\n\r\nI figure this might need more work, or maybe it's not the best approach. But currently it makes it much easier to use VSCode's git capabilities for projects with a lot of untracked files.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32147996/63982528-d2aa7a80-ca90-11e9-9724-e655e725477f.png)\r\n\r\n(Addresses #35480)"}]
