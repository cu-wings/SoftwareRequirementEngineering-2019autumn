Description\r\n\r\nZero width characters can be used in some programs or to fingerprint people.\r\n\r\nSee [Zero-Width Characters - Invisibly fingerprinting text](https://www.zachaysan.com/writing/2017-12-30-zero-width-characters) and [Be careful what you copy: Invisibly inserting usernames into text with Zero-Width Characters](https://medium.com/@umpox/be-careful-what-you-copy-invisibly-inserting-usernames-into-text-with-zero-width-characters-18b4e6f17b66).\r\n\r\nThose characters are not rendered in anyway, making hard to detect them.\r\n\r\nSo we need an option to:\r\n\r\n- render invisible chars as their UTFx code (like in nvim <200b>\r\n- or to render any invisible char as one arbitrary chosen char like for whitespace\r\n\r\n[Invisible Character Visualizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ShaneRay.InvisibleCharacterVisualizer) seems to do that well so the feature can start from this plugin instead from scratch.\r\n \r\nSecond thing, the show whitespace feature of vscode is only displaying whitespaces and tabs but not CR and EOL like many editors.\r\n\r\nFor example in atom \r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UFnP20p.png)\r\n\r\n## Possible related issues and resources\r\n\r\n- View invisible characters #31291\r\n- Feature request: Show hidden characters like: space, tab, end of line, carriage return #18282\r\n- Invisible Character Visualizer https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ShaneRay.InvisibleCharacterVisualizer, but this is for Visual Studio not for VS Code\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n\r\nVS Code (not even a clue there is something)\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/R9EMSWX.png)\r\n\r\nneovim

fix for #1304\r\n\r\n**Problem**\r\nSnippets are currently shown at all locations in a file. In js/ts for example, this results in us suggesting the `for` loop snippet inside of class bodies or in function calls\r\n\r\n**Proposal**\r\nAllow built-in and user snippets to specify a `when` clause that determines if the snippet should be shown:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"Print to console\": {\r\n\t\t\"prefix\": \"log\",\r\n\t\t\"body\": [\r\n\t\t\t\"console.log('$1');\",\r\n\t\t\t\"$2\"\r\n\t\t],\r\n\t\t\"description\": \"Log output to console\",\r\n\t\t\"when\": \"completionContext ~= statement\"\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen allow this `when` clause to be dynamically controlled by an extension. One thought is to provide this as metadata on the `CompletionList` object:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport class CompletionList {\r\n    isIncomplete?: boolean;\r\n    items: CompletionItem[];\r\n    \r\n    completionContext?: string;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, the `completionContext` contextkey used in the `when` would be set from `CompletionList` that VS Code gets from the

I have a lot of auto closing pairs\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Serhioromano/vscode-st/blob/master/language-configuration.json\r\n\r\nThe problem I meet that not every user like it. But some do like. I also have number of snippets that cover the same scope. It is personal preference. Some like to type with autoclose, some like snippets. And those who like snippets ask me to get rid of autoclose.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to add a parameter to enable it or disable? For instance.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"autoClosingPairs\": [\r\n\t{\"open\": \"{\", \"close\": \"}\"},\r\n\t{\"open\": \"[\", \"close\": \"]\"},\r\n\t{\"open\": \"VAR_INPUT\", \"close\": \"END_VAR\", \"notIn\": [\"string\"], \"option\" : \"st.autoclose.vars\"},\r\n\t{\"open\": \"PROGRAM\", \"close\": \"END_PROGRAM\", \"notIn\": [\"string\"], \"option\" : \"st.autoclose.keys\"},\r\n```\r\nThis new `\"option\" : \"st.autoclose.vars\"` tells that VSC should autoclose only if `st.autoclose.vars` parameter is set to `TRUE`. And I define this parameter in `package.json` in `contributes.configuration`\r\n\r\nTo me it looks simple and effective.

Move a file from the explorer to a subfolder in the same directory\r\n\r\nThe whole application is now frozen (at least visually) and behaves extremely strange with my window manager/ compositor (i3-gaps). I cannot force quit, and have to sigkill the process in htop or something.\r\n\r\nNow time for the strange part - there are two binaries I get of vscode from this package: https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=visual-studio-code-bin\r\n\r\nOne in `/opt/visual-studio-code/code`, and another in `/opt/visual-studio-code/bin/code`. The `/opt/visual-studio-code/code` has this bug. The one in  `/opt/visual-studio-code/bin/code` does not. This is a problem because the default FreeDesktopOrg desktop file for code points to the first, which has the bug.\r\n\r\nNote about the bug:\r\nOn the bug-free binary, when dragging the file, the whole destination sub-folder is highlighted before release, while on the bugged binary it doesn't highlight (and the tool tip breaks, and on release, everything breaks)\r\n\r\nI have temporarily fixed the issue by pointing my desktop file for code to `/usr/bin/code` (which I think is the one in `/opt/visual-studio-code/bin/`) instead. If you guys think this is an issue more specific to my linux distribution/ package, I let the package maintainer know about this as well.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the process doesn't response (at least the frontend) and behaves strangely with my wm/compositor leads me to believe that the problem is more so on the rendering side.
