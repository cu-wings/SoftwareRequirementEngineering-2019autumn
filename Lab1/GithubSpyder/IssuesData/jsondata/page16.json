off this is similar to another request https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/30419 but I think different enough it deserves its own post.\r\n\r\nI have so many tasks, most of which are just variations of another....\r\n\r\nI find the recently used suggestions to mostly hinder my experience as I have to keep searching the list for the task I would like to run.\r\n\r\nI would like to see the ability to set the number of \"recently used tasks\". This way I can limit it to only show 2 or 3.\r\n\r\nThe other configuration I would like is to be able to always show the tasks in alphabetical order.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the suggested task list is formatted as such:\r\n\r\n```\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nrecently used tasks (sorted by last used)\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nremaining declared tasks (sorted alphabetically)\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\ndetected tasks\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nbuild-x-debug             recently used tasks\r\nserve-y-debug\r\nbuild-y-debug\r\nupdate-major\r\nbuild-y-live\r\nserve-x-debug\r\nbuild-all-prod\r\nserve-x-live\r\nbuild-x-live\r\nupdate-minor\r\nbuild-y-prod\r\nbuild-y-prod\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nbuild-all-test                configure tasks\r\nbuild-x-prod\r\nserve-y-live\r\nupdate-patch\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nnpm: install                   detected tasks\r\nnpm: e2e\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn other words if a task is the recently used list it will not be in the centre list, ideally I think it would be beneficial to have this centre list always contain every task that is defined that way you can skim the recently used list but if you miss it there, you will know that it is always going to be in the same spot in that centre list. Along with limiting the number of recently used tasks I believe this will make the suggested list much more usable.\r\n\r\n```\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nrecently used tasks (sorted by last used)\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nall declared tasks (sorted alphabetically)\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\ndetected

Notice there is a tree view at the bottom. Try switching to browse mode (ctrl+space or enter) when you have moved to it with the arrow keys. Enter doesn't work, and when pressing ctrl+ space the arrow keys don't work either. Object Navigation does not help either because it only shows some of the items. Tabbing is possible, but with the man y settings there are it is somewhat impractical, though filtering helps a bit. Also, when tabbing, sometimes NVDA goes silent, and when changing combo box values the arrows don't echo selected choices. The only way to use combo boxes is to use NVDA + Numpad Enter to open the combo box.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/80630","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/80630/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/80630/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/80630/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/80630","id":491553280,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0OTE1NTMyODA=","number":80630,"title":"Web:

To do so I currently have to write something like this:\r\n\r\n`/path/to/folder1/*.foo, /path/to/folder1/*.bar, /path/to/folder2/*.foo, /path/to/folder2/*.bar, /path/to/folder3/*.foo,

This makes CMD/CTRL+F consistent with other editors/IDEs (actually, almost all software on all platforms).\r\n\r\nWithout any text selected, the current behavior (with `seedSearchStringFromSelection` enabled) is to search for whatever word is under the cursor. This is unexpected because all (>99%) other software simply keeps the search field unchanged, so you can continue searching. Try it in some JetBrains IDE, Eclipse, NetBeans, Sublime, Notepad++, Firefox or Chrome in an input field, MS Word, or any other popular software. Nobody does that except for VS Code, so it breaks common user expectations and makes a very common use-case annoying (i.e. continuing from the last search).\r\n\r\nThat's why I have fully removed the old behavior.

There are many criteria that could be used for that. I think **it's beneficial to have those criteria described in a way that's transparent and well-defined** (to allow discussing the best way to optimize suggestion orders) **and also customizable** (so that users can optimize it to their way of thinking).\r\n\r\nSo, with this in mind, I'd like to suggest a good system for ordering editor suggestions. My intention is just to provide the idea of having a logic for ordering that is customizable in **ORDER BY semantics** (like in SQL). And to have the criteria described here (the ones not already implemented) being considered, so that the relevance of suggestions can be further improved.\r\n\r\nBy \"order by\" semantics, I mean the system works with multiple levels of sorting, where each criterion is used as a tiebreaker for the previous one.\r\n\r\nI know that some of these criteria are already present on VSCode, but there are some things which haven't been considered yet, so I'd like to describe how I think the thing as a whole could work first, and then describe the actual feature requests at the end.\r\n\r\n### Considerations\r\n\r\nFirstly, I'm not considering filter relevance, which is the ordering criterion that sorts matches when the name is partially typed (so that exact prefix matches come before other substring matches, for example). That logic would likely be applied separately from this system (and VSCode already does a good job on this regard).\r\n\r\nAlso, there are two ways to trigger suggestions. The first is member suggestions (triggered with <kbd>.</kbd> after an expression, for a member token) which is NOT what I intend to describe here, although some things here might be useful for that too. Related: #50755 \r\n\r\nWhat I'm describing refers to **general suggestions** (triggered by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Space</kbd> for a \"top-level\" token). In this case the possibilities are too broad. Because of this, the suggestion mixes everything: members of the implicit `this`, local variables/parameters, classes, etc. It's difficult to know the user's intention, but there are some things we can consider.\r\n\r\nFor example, in a method body, it might be a good idea to show local variables/parameters before members, since you can already have members shown first when you type `this`<kbd>.</kbd>.\r\nYou may also want to sort elements by proximity in code (distance from declaration to usage; near first), if they are otherwise equally likely to be chosen.\r\nAnd, most importantly, if the context receiving the value implies a type (like in an assignment or a parameter in a function call) then it would be great to have values with a compatible type being presented before the others.\r\n\r\n### Criteria for Ordering Suggestions\r\n\r\nSo, for general suggestions, I would do an \"order by\" in this order by default (of course, considering only whatever is applicable depending on context).\r\nThe default orders here are just an example, they are debatable, of course.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the ordering by **primary category**\r\n1. Existing identifiers\r\nThe most important category, so it goes first\r\n2. Smart name suggestions, for new identifiers\r\nFor example, after `var` or `class`; if there is context allowing smart suggestions\r\n3. Word-based suggestions; when enabled\r\n4. Native elements from the language (like keywords), if enabled\r\nLeast important, since user likely knows these already (so it goes on middle-end part)\r\n5. Elements customizable by the local user (like templates/constructs)\r\nShown last so you can easily list them by pressing <kbd>Up</kbd>\r\n\r\nThen, for identifiers, tiebreakers on this order:\r\n1. By **type compatibility** with what is expected on where the cursor is\r\nThat's how well the type or return type fits in the receiving type\r\nOnly applicable for identifiers that have or are types\r\nOnly applicable in places like assignment, argument, after `return` or `new`, etc\r\n    1. Exact type and subtype matches\r\n    2. Other implicitly castable matches\r\n    3. Explicitly castable matches (like supertypes, sorted by \"distance\" to expected type)\r\n    4. Elements that don't match, but still have or are types\r\n    5. Typeless elements, where this isn't applicable (they have nothing to do with types)\r\n2. Then, by **syntax explicitness**\r\n    1. Elements that have to be referenced necessarily in the current syntax (like variables/parameters)\r\n    2. Elements implicitly included in the scope, which could have been accessed with a more explicit syntax instead (like members of the current class)\r\n    3. Elements implicitly included by extension syntax\r\n    4. Other \"syntatic sugars\"\r\n3. Then, by **declaration proximity** (defined below)\r\n4. Then, by **semantic purpose**\r\nYou might want to have those grouped or further separated on each type of language element\r\n    1. Identifiers that have type and value (like local variables/parameters, function calls, etc)\r\n    2. Identifiers for types (like classes/interfaces/enums, type parameters)\r\n    3. Identifiers for macros and the like\r\n    4. Identifiers for scopes (like namespaces/imports and elements returned from require() in JS)\r\n    5. Other identifiers (like labels, etc)\r\n5. Lastly, by **name**, alphabetically\r\n\r\nDeclaration proximity is defined in this order:\r\n1. By proximity of source\r\n    1. Elements from the same file / compilation unit\r\n    2. Elements from the same project\r\n    2. Elements from dependency libraries\r\n    3. Elements from standard/native libraries (user might know these already)\r\n2. Then, if on same file/unit, by proximity of scope where element is declared\r\n    1. Same scope first, then outer scopes, in order\r\n    2. Inner scopes go last, if applicable (for languages like JS)\r\n3. Then, if on same scope and file, by proximity of the line in code where element is declared\r\nOnly applicable where semantics imply order makes difference in usefulness of suggestion (e.g. vars)\r\n    1. If before the cursor, sort by line in decreasing order, so that the line right above is shown first\r\n    2. If after the cursor, is shown last, if applicable (for languages like JS)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo, with these citeria, you could have settings to control sorting with \"order by\" syntax:\r\n```jsonc\r\n// Primary order for IntelliSense suggestions\r\n\"editor.suggest.primaryOrder\": [\r\n  \"identifiers\", \"smartNames\", \"words\", \"language\", \"user\"\r\n]\r\n// Precedence of criteria used for ordering identifier suggestions (higher precedence first)\r\n// It's possible to disable a criterion by removing it from the list\r\n\"editor.suggest.identifiersOrderBy\": [\r\n  \"typeCompatibility\", // types that directly fit first, non-matches and typeless last\r\n  \"syntaxExplicitness\", // explicit syntax first, syntatic sugar last\r\n  \"declarationProximity\", // same scope and near cursor first\r\n  \"semanticPurpose\", // separates things like e.g. variables / classes / namespaces\r\n  \"name\", // a-z A-Z _ (or whatever ordering is set by the language)\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\nSo, if this system were to be fully implemented, it would need these feature requests (based on what I think wasn't implemented yet)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Having suggestions use **ORDER BY semantics**, allowing better transparency of ordering criteria\r\n    - [ ] Settings to customize the order criteria for identifier suggestions\r\n- [ ] Having **type compatibility criterion** for suggestions (aka Smart Completion)\r\n- [ ] (if that makes sense): Having **syntax explicitness criterion** for suggestions\r\n- [ ] (maybe, if it's worth implementing eventually): Having smart name suggestions?"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/80442","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/80442/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/80442/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/80442/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/80442","id":490085808,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0OTAwODU4MDg=","number":80442,"title":"Use the launch configuration name as the terminal name","user":{"login":"cameronbraid","id":672405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MjQwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/672405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronbraid","html_url":"https://github.com/cameronbraid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronbraid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronbraid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronbraid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronbraid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronbraid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronbraid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronbraid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronbraid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronbraid/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291054922,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTEwNTQ5MjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/debug","name":"debug","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689392,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODkzOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"dcdcdc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTgxNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTgxNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2019-09-06T01:40:14Z","updated_at":"2019-09-11T14:17:00Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Currently when running or debugging a launch target, the default terminal names are generic and don't reflect the launch target.  \r\n\r\nThis makes it hard to know which terminal relates to which launch, particularly when you have 3 or more launches running.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\na Java launch target named `Debug (Launch) -

Therefore I would like to provide watch() functionality through my extension.\r\n\r\nCurrently the only way an extension can provide file watching capability is through the FileSystemProvider API. Today, attempting to add a FileSystemProvider for the file:// URI scheme leads to an error: `a provider for the scheme 'file' is already registered`.\r\n\r\nProposal:\r\nI can picture a couple of ways to enable my use case:\r\n1) (I prefer this one) Lift the FileSystemProvider's restriction on the 'file' scheme. This would involve removing 'file' from the list of pre-registered schemas [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/b283b2978139ea12cee702164bd991f055e3fb92/src/vs/workbench/api/common/extHostFileSystem.ts#L168) on extHostFileSystem.ts. I believe the provider itself is registered  at `electron-main/app.ts`:\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/b283b2978139ea12cee702164bd991f055e3fb92/src/vs/code/electron-main/app.ts#L430-L431\r\n\r\n2) Add a new 'registerFileWatcher' proposed API, similar to the existing textSearch/fileSearch proposals, to enable an extension to solely provide the file watching capability for a given scheme.\r\n\r\nTradeoffs:\r\nApproach 1 offers the most generic approach that I believe would be useful to other extension authors as well. However it requires an extension to implement all FileSystemProvider methods, even if it only needs to replace default behavior for a subset of them. It also could lead to the possibility of extensions conflicting and fighting to register the 'file' provider. Approach 2 lessens these downsides but it leads to ambiguity in resolving the watch capability, since it could be provided in 2 places in the API.\r\n\r\ncc @aeschli
