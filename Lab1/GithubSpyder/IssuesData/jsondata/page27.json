Reproduce:\r\n\r\nFolder structure (**myrepo** contains a subfolder that I wish to open in VS Code, called goproject, but I wish to open a symlink so its cwd is in `/go/src/`. `myrepo` also contains the `.git` folder):\r\n```\r\nD:\\DEV\\myrepo\r\n│   docker-compose.yaml\r\n│\r\n└───goproject\r\n    └───.devcontainer\r\n            devcontainer.json\r\n            Dockerfile\r\n```\r\n`D:\\DEV\\myrepo\\docker-compose.yaml`:\r\n```yaml\r\nversion: '3'\r\nservices:\r\n  goproject:\r\n    build:\r\n      context: .\r\n      dockerfile: ./goproject/.devcontainer/Dockerfile\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - .:/workspace\r\n\r\n    # [Optional] Required for ptrace-based debuggers like C++, Go, and Rust\r\n    cap_add:\r\n      - SYS_PTRACE\r\n    security_opt:\r\n      - seccomp:unconfined\r\n\r\n    # Overrides default command so things don't shut down after the process ends.\r\n    command: sleep infinity\r\n```\r\n\r\n`D:\\DEV\\myrepo\\goproject\\.devcontainer\\Dockerfile`: (mostly borrowed from: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-remote-try-go):\r\n\r\n```\r\n<snip> // contents from remote-try-go here\r\n\r\nENV GIT_DIR=\"/workspace/.git\"\r\nRUN \\\r\n    mkdir -p /go/src/mydomain.com ; \\\r\n    ln -s /workspace/goproject /go/src/mydomain.com/goproject\r\n\r\nENV \\\r\n    SHELL=/bin/bash\r\n```\r\nAnd the devcontainer.json file... Notice I set the `workspaceFolder` to the location of the symlink I created in the Dockerfile.\r\n\r\n`D:\\DEV\\myrepo\\goproject\\.devcontainer\\devcontainer.json`:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"name\": \"goproject\",\r\n\t\"dockerComposeFile\": [\"../../docker-compose.yaml\"],\r\n\t\"service\": \"goproject\",\r\n\t\"workspaceFolder\": \"/go/src/mydomain.com/goproject\",\r\n\t\"appPort\": 9000,\r\n\t\"extensions\": [\r\n\t\t\"ms-vscode.go\"\r\n\t],\r\n\t\"settings\": {\r\n\t\t\"go.gopath\": \"/go\",\r\n\t\t\"go.inferGopath\": true,\r\n\t\t\"go.useLanguageServer\": true,\r\n\t\t// \"search.followSymlinks\": false, // tried this only half-expecting it to work in this case\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I open this in a dev container, my workspaceFolder is set to the directory pointed to from the symlink, `/workspace/goproject`.\r\n\r\nFrom issues like microsoft/vscode#18837 and microsoft/vscode#74104, it seems like **not** following symlinks is now the desired default behavior for VS Code, except for searches, and it's the behavior I'm looking for. Since it follows symlinks, I am unable to set my VSCode workspaceFolder to the symlink (a folder in the GOPATH) - it opens the subdirectory of my workspace instead.\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes/No\r\nI don't think I can run devcontainers with extensions

The user then has to manually scroll to the top of the list in order to see the properties expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ninterface Something {\r\n    propertyOne: any,\r\n    propertyTwo: any,\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst someFunction = (something: Something) => {};\r\n\r\nsomeFunction({ <focus here and press CTRL + SPACE> });\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5633938/61282052-9659de00-a7b2-11e9-8921-d796258c6928.png)\r\n\r\nThe user then has to scroll to the top:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5633938/61282180-c6a17c80-a7b2-11e9-9e21-340ea6258ff2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nI suggest that the intellisense menu scrolls to the very top always (why is it currently in the middle, for example). TypeScript has already inferred what properties are available, so it should be a case of fixing the default selected item in the intellisense menu.\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.36.1

Currently, a custom `resolveDebugConfiguration` handler can return a `DebugConfiguration` object with a different type, but this configuration is not resolved through VS Code before it is run.\r\n\r\n(cc: @roblourens , @weinand )\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\n\r\nI'm developing an extension that allows users to develop and debug serverless applications. I'd like to provide debug support using the Debug panel of VS Code. My thought is that users would set up launch.config to reference their application's serverless manifest file. The manifest file knows the details required to run the application (code location, function handler to launch, etc), as well as whether the application is written in node, python, or c#. My extension would resolve this information from the manifest, and launch the appropriate debugger for the serverless application.\r\n\r\n# Sample\r\n\r\nHere is a small example of a custom debug type that passes through a different config type\r\n\r\nIn extension activate:\r\n```\r\n    vscode.debug.registerDebugConfigurationProvider(\r\n        'mydebugtype',\r\n        new MyDebugConfigProvider(),\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe declarations:\r\n```\r\ninterface MyDebugConfig extends vscode.DebugConfiguration {\r\n    config: vscode.DebugConfiguration\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass MyDebugConfigProvider implements vscode.DebugConfigurationProvider {\r\n\r\n    public async resolveDebugConfiguration(\r\n        folder: vscode.WorkspaceFolder | undefined, \r\n        debugConfiguration: MyDebugConfig, \r\n        token?: vscode.CancellationToken\r\n    ): Promise<vscode.DebugConfiguration | undefined> {\r\n        return debugConfiguration.config\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn launch.json:\r\n```\r\n        {\r\n            \"type\": \"mydebugtype\",\r\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\r\n            \"name\": \"My Sample Debug\",\r\n            \"config\": {\r\n                \"name\": \"My Sample Debug\",\r\n                \"type\": \"node\",\r\n                \"request\": \"launch\",\r\n                \"program\": \"${workspaceFolder}/app.js\",\r\n                \"protocol\": \"inspector\"\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"name\": \"Regular Sample Debug\",\r\n            \"type\": \"node\",\r\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\r\n            \"program\": \"${workspaceFolder}/app.js\",\r\n            \"protocol\": \"inspector\"\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, running `Regular Sample Debug` works as expected. `My Sample Debug` contains the same payload as `Regular Sample Debug` in the `config` property. When I run `My Sample Debug`, I would expect my configuration provider to launder the mydebugtype config into a valid node config, which looks and behaves exactly like `Regular Sample Debug` does. The actual result in Debug Console is:\r\n```\r\nC:\\Users\\<......>\\node.exe --nolazy --debug-brk=61651 app.js\r\n(node:13544) [DEP0062] DeprecationWarning: `node --debug` and `node --debug-brk` are invalid. Please use `node --inspect` or `node --inspect-brk` instead.\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Alternate Workarounds Considered\r\n\r\n1 - Register my configuration provider to first-class debug types of interest (such as 'node' and/or 'python).\r\n\r\nI tried to register `MyDebugConfigProvider` to debug type 'node'. In launch.config, I added a custom property \"X\" to the configuration, where I placed all of the fields of interest to `MyDebugConfigProvider`. In `resolveDebugConfiguration`, I check for the presence of \"X\". If it is not present, the configuration is returned without processing or modification. If \"X\" is present, I perform all necessary processing, and return a DebugConfiguration object of type 'node' that is configured to run the program of interest.\r\n\r\nPros\r\n* It works!\r\n\r\nCons\r\n* Unsure if this is a valid approach. Is it expected that several VS Code extensions would register `DebugConfigurationProvider`s against types like 'node' or 'python'?\r\n* When the extension is active, `MyDebugConfigProvider` runs against *all* user launch configurations for those types (eg: anything with a debug type of 'node'), even if they are debugging programs that aren't relevant to this extension (eg: even if the configuration does not contain \"X\"). That seems invasive.\r\n* `MyDebugConfigProvider` has to be explicitly registered against all of the different types it is supporting\r\n  * This appears to also require duplicate declarations in the package.json contribution points for each type, in `configurationAttributes`\r\n* When users of my extension are setting up launch configurations, they have to set the correct debug type themselves (instructing users to set the type to a single value like \"mydebugtype\" reduces confusion/chance of misconfiguration)\r\n\r\n2 - Register my configuration provider to custom type (\"mydebugtype\"), and explicitly call `vscode.debug.startDebugging`\r\n\r\nGiven `MyDebugConfig` from earlier, I have `resolveDebugConfiguration` call `vscode.debug.startDebugging` with the payload from `MyDebugConfig.config`. `resolveDebugConfiguration` then returns `undefined`.\r\n\r\nPros\r\n* It works!\r\n\r\nCons\r\n* This does not seem compatible with the spirit of `resolveDebugConfiguration`. We're halting the requested debug session from starting and spinning up an alternate one instead of taking the requested session and setting it up to run\r\n* Unsure if there are any side effects or constraints (like a timeout limit) that come with operating from within `resolveDebugConfiguration`\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77364","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77364/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77364/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77364/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/77364","id":467860607,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0Njc4NjA2MDc=","number":77364,"title":"Texteditor decoration not rendered properly if minimap enabled","user":{"login":"maziac","id":3081973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODE5NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3081973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maziac","html_url":"https://github.com/maziac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maziac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maziac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maziac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maziac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maziac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maziac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maziac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maziac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maziac/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":543648956,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NDM2NDg5NTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-minimap","name":"editor-minimap","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":756920294,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NTY5MjAyOTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-rendering","name":"editor-rendering","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":272689392,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODkzOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"dcdcdc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2019-07-14T16:44:31Z","updated_at":"2019-10-11T21:58:42Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.36.1\r\n- OS Version: macOS 10.14.5\r\n\r\nI have used this decoration style:\r\n\r\n\t\trevDbgDecoType = vscode.window.createTextEditorDecorationType({\r\n\t\t\tisWholeLine: true,\r\n\t\t\tgutterIconSize: 'auto',\r\n\t\t\tborderWidth: '1px',\r\n\t\t\tborderStyle: 'solid',\r\n\t\t\tborderRadius: '5px',\r\n\t\t});\r\n\r\nThe decorations get rendered and look correctly like this:\r\n![Bildschirmfoto 2019-07-14 um 18 40 15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3081973/61186536-f8a5c800-a666-11e9-87bd-a8b66008a1fc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf now the minimap is enabled for the TextEditor it looks like:\r\n\r\n![Bildschirmfoto 2019-07-14 um 18 38 29](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3081973/61186512-a2388980-a666-11e9-9657-e5f7b1fdcd8e.jpg)\r\n\r\nAs you can see the right border of the rectangle cannot be seen anymore.

Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a file with a first line that is longer that 100 characters that matches a `firstLine` regexp of some language, where the regexp wants to match something at the end of the line.\r\nAs an example the `shellscript` language [defines](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/844c7f1c94c7cadb25d46fb97f0d3d4c4b66b3cc/extensions/shellscript/package.json#L17) the `firstLine` detection with:\r\n```\r\n\"firstLine\": \"^#!.*\\\\b(bash|zsh|sh|tcsh).*|^#\\\\s*-\\\\*-[^*]*mode:\\\\s*shell-script[^*]*-\\\\*-\",\r\n```\r\nwhich wants to match a `-*-` at the end of the line.\r\n2. Open the file and observe that the language is not detected. Shortening the first line to no more than 100 characters, closing the line and opening it again, makes the language be detected.\r\nE.g. a file name `test-file` containing the following text:\r\n```\r\n# -*- mode:shell-script; some-more:1; some-more:1; some-more:1; some-more:1; some-more7890123:12; -*-\r\n#234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890\r\n#        ^10       ^20       ^30       ^40       ^50       ^60       ^70       ^80       ^90       ^100\r\n```\r\nwill not be detected as containing `shellscript` language. Changing the final \"12\" to \"1\" brings the length down to 100 and now it _will_ be detected as `shellscript`.\r\n\r\nPresumably this is because of the `100` at [textEditorModel.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/150730fbd7082f8bc442a0b79100a83c868e846e/src/vs/workbench/common/editor/textEditorModel.ts#L109).\r\n\r\nFor Emacs-style mode lines, like the ones `shellscript` tries to detect, contain file-specific \"settings\", so they can be quite long. At a minimum, the magic number 100 ought to be documented.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77303","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77303/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77303/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77303/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/77303","id":467562168,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0Njc1NjIxNjg=","number":77303,"title":"Path
