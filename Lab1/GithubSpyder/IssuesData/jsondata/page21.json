Share has a feature where when a user starts a collaboration session as a host, all existing terminals are automatically shared. When other guests join, they'll see these shared terminals. \r\n\r\nThe problem is that guests' UI dimensions are different from the host, and such shared  terminals may not render correctly there.\r\n\r\nLive Share already solves this for `Pseudoterminal` that users can create via Live Share viewlet. Live Share uses `onDidOverrideDimensions` and `setDimensions` on `Pseudoterminal`. It needs VSCode support for regular `Terminal` objects.\r\n\r\nExisting terminals has read-only `dimensions` property on `Terminal` objects which we can use to get current terminal dimensions (maximum ones I assume), but nothing that we can use to change the dimensions, and no event that would tell us when UI changes and max dimensions change.\r\n\r\nSo the feature request is to expose `onDidOverrideDimensions` and `setDimensions` equivalent on `Terminal` objects that would allow to:\r\n1. Override current terminal dimensions\r\n2. Get current max dimensions as allowed by UI\r\n3. Know when max dimensions change (say when users resize UI).\r\n\r\ncc @lostintangent, @Tyriar
