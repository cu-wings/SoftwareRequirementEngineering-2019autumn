VSCode uses `tasks.json` to detect the tasks. If there is a `FileSystemProvider` registered, it will use it to read `tasks.json`. The problem with that is the tasks may not make sense if they come from something else other than `file:/.../.vscode/tasks.json`. E.g. if the file system provider is of a remote kind (like fetching files from sftp or Live Share), tasks from `tasks.json` most likely won't work locally.\r\n\r\nTo deal with this scenario, VSCode may provide different options:\r\n1. An ability to override task execution for any tasks from `tasks.json`. This work may be merged into #33523. VSCode should pass along the URI of the original `tasks.json` to the extension code that overrides the task execution.\r\n1.  An ability to disable tasks detection from `tasks.json` based on the file scheme. This will be a new API. Alternatively, you can make VSCode respect `tasks.json` only from `file:` scheme and let the extensions opt in other schemes if they so chose.\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/73734","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/73734/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/73734/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/73734/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/73734","id":444023115,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NDQwMjMxMTU=","number":73734,"title":"Interactive playground completion list is moving around","user":{"login":"sana-ajani","id":9721254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MjEyNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/9721254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sana-ajani","html_url":"https://github.com/sana-ajani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sana-ajani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sana-ajani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sana-ajani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sana-ajani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sana-ajani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sana-ajani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sana-ajani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sana-ajani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sana-ajani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129993,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTYxMjk5OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"8D6673","default":true},{"id":752419772,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NTI0MTk3NzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench-welcome","name":"workbench-welcome","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDc4OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDc4OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2019-05-14T16:55:36Z","updated_at":"2019-07-22T10:48:50Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"\r\nVersion: 1.34.20-insider (user setup)\r\nCommit: 57b550c559b945eb9d871dbf2b2e4cb9e31e2551\r\nDate: 2019-05-10T17:36:45.765Z\r\nElectron: 3.1.8\r\nChrome: 66.0.3359.181\r\nNode.js: 10.2.0\r\nV8: 6.6.346.32\r\nOS: Windows_NT x64 10.0.18362\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.

opening folders or files while using remote access through ssh with VS Code insiders (thanks, it is working fantastic and as expected),  text completion seems oblivious to upper-case when suggesting files. Let me show you with an example.\r\n\r\nLet's say you want to open ./Axyz but . also contains folders abc.\r\nWhat happens usually is that one would press \"A\" and then tab, expecting it to get completed as Axyz. Instead, VS Code Insiders puts the prompt over the first choice in alphabetical order, abc. Thus, doing \"A\"+TAB complets as /abc/.\r\n\r\nIt is counter-intuitive with every other text completion that I know, including Intellisense, could you please change that or add an option ?\r\n\r\nIt

had an issue raised by a user that say my extension activate spawn its language server while they were working on an unrelated (non-Dart) project (https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1699).\r\n\r\nIt turns out that there is a hard-coded timeout of 7 seconds for `workspaceContains` activation events and this user hit that (possibly through a combination or large folder, and machine being busy, other extensions loading, running emulators etc.):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/b4cd3749542a0da6f9cf830d49fdc4bd9e9bc4f5/src/vs/workbench/api/node/extHostExtensionService.ts#L50\r\n\r\nThe behaviour when this timeout is hit is to pre-emptively activate the extensions in this case. I understand why this is done but it seems like it may trade one problem (searching the tree) for another (activating a bunch of unrelated extensions that may spawn language servers).\r\n\r\nI think there should be more control (for users or extensions) over this behaviour, for example:\r\n\r\n- Being able to configure the timeout\r\n- Being able to change the behaviour of whether to load extensions when this happens (or be prompted and warned)\r\n- Showing the activation reason in the \"Show Running Extensions\" section\r\n- Allowing extensions to control whether to activate when workspaceContains times out (in my case, it's fine not to - workspaceContains is for convenience so the user doesn't need to open a `.dart` file before we activate, but if no Dart or pubspec.yaml was found in 7 seconds, it would be preferable to wait for the user to open one (or one be discovered in the tree) before activating)\r\n- Telling the extension the activation reason (https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/44711)\r\n\r\nOf course, the extension could scan the tree and not spawn the language server, but then it's just doing the work that VS Code specifically was trying to avoid, and if multiple extensions are all doing it, it'll be worse performing than if VS Code did it!"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/73635","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/73635/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/73635/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/73635/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/73635","id":443100251,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NDMxMDAyNTE=","number":73635,"title":"A

config to test it\r\n\r\nIn short:\r\n- In `vue-html` embedded in `vue`, I would expect setting `vue-html`'s indentation rules would affect move line up/down\r\n- I have to set both indentation rules

Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nSince updating VS Code Insiders sometime last week (sorry I don't know exactly which build), I've been unable to debug our remote authority resolver, using the same steps that had worked with builds prior to that.\r\n\r\nFirst, some background... We have a resolver extension for the \"cloudenv\" remote authority. It has the appropriate activation event declared in package.json:\r\n```\r\n\"activationEvents\": [\r\n  \"onResolveRemoteAuthority:cloudenv\"\r\n],\r\n```\r\nAnd we register the resolver in the extension activate() function:\r\n```\r\n    context.subscriptions.push(\r\n        vscode.workspace.registerRemoteAuthorityResolver('cloudenv', resolver));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis \"Cloud Environments\" resolver mostly works; in fact we demoed it at the build event. But not being able to debug it makes further development very difficult. I'm trying two approaches, both of which worked previously.\r\n\r\n1. Launch VS Code with a remote URI specified directly in launch.json:\r\n```\r\n\"name\": \"Launch Extension\",\r\n\"type\": \"extensionHost\",\r\n\"request\": \"launch\",\r\n\"runtimeExecutable\": \"${execPath}\",\r\n\"args\": [\r\n  \"--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceRoot}\",\r\n  \"--folder-uri\",\r\n  \"vscode-remote://cloudenv+...\"\r\n],\r\n```\r\nNow the launched VS Code seems to ignore the remote URI: the resolver extension does not get activated at all. It's the same if I launch from the command-line with the exact same arguments. But if I remove the `--extensionDevelopmentPath` arg (and actually install the extension) then the resolver does get activated. Apparently it can no longer handle both at the same time.\r\n\r\n2. Open a remote folder via a command:\r\n```\r\nvscode.commands.executeCommand(\r\n  'vscode.openFolder', vscode.Uri.parse('vscode-remote://cloudenv+...'));\r\n```\r\nSince launching a remote URI directly doesn't work, I tried first launching a local window and then opening a remote folder with a command. Then the resolver does get activated after the reload. But the debugger does not attach to it. Breakpoints in either the extension activate() method or the resolve callback don't get hit.\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code - Insiders 1.34.0-insider (693a13cd32c5be798051edc0cb43e1e39fc456d9, 2019-05-08T21:17:09.160Z)\r\nOS version: Windows_NT x64 10.0.18362"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/73547","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/73547/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/73547/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/73547/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/73547","id":442391035,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NDIzOTEwMzU=","number":73547,"title":"Automatic Indentation doesn't work for single line conditionals in C/C++","user":{"login":"cseas","id":29686866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5Njg2ODY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/29686866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cseas","html_url":"https://github.com/cseas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cseas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cseas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cseas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cseas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cseas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cseas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cseas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cseas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cseas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":577463440,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1Nzc0NjM0NDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-autoindent","name":"editor-autoindent","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjkyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjkyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2019-05-09T19:16:40Z","updated_at":"2019-05-09T19:56:24Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.33.1\r\n- OS Version: Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nPress Enter after typing an `if` or `for` statement in a C program without using curly braces.\r\n\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour:\r\n```\r\nif(true)\r\n    i++;\r\n\r\nfor(i=0; i<n; i++)\r\n    j++;\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrent behaviour:\r\n```\r\nif(true)\r\ni++;\r\n\r\nfor(i=0; i<n; i++)\r\nj++;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's common in C/C++ programming to avoid using the curly braces after conditionals like `if` and `for` when the statement succeeding them is only one line.
