attempting to move over to `TaskProvider` for [our extension](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-azurefunctions) rather than custom shell tasks. Per [these docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/example-tasks#_task-definition), the TaskDefinition provided through TaskProvider is used \"To uniquely identify a task in the system\", but I don't just want to \"identify\" the task, I want to let users customize it as well.\r\n\r\nFor example, we want to provide a task that starts the Azure Functions host before a user debugs. The launch.json would look like this:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\r\n  \"configurations\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"Attach to JavaScript Functions\",\r\n      \"type\": \"node\",\r\n      \"request\": \"attach\",\r\n      \"port\": 5858,\r\n      \"preLaunchTask\": \"func: host start\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I would provide the \"func: host start\" task like this:\r\n```typescript\r\nexport class FuncTaskProvider implements TaskProvider {\r\n    public async provideTasks(token?: CancellationToken | undefined): Promise<Task[]> {\r\n        const taskDefinition: TaskDefinition = { type: 'func', command: 'host start', port: 5858 };\r\n        const task: Task = new Task(\r\n            taskDefinition,\r\n            'host start',\r\n            'func',\r\n            new ProcessExecution('func', ['host', 'start', '--language-worker', '--', `--inspect=${taskDefinition.port}`]),\r\n            '$func-watch'\r\n        );\r\n        return [task];\r\n    }\r\n \r\n    public async resolveTask(task: Task, token?: CancellationToken | undefined): Promise<Task> {\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, as soon as I try to change the port, I get an error like this:\r\n```\r\nError: The func task detection didn't contribute a task for the following configuration:\r\n{\r\n    \"type\": \"func\",\r\n    \"command\": \"host start\",\r\n    \"port\": 5959,\r\n    \"problemMatcher\": [\r\n        \"$func-watch\"\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\nThe task will be ignored.\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc @dbaeumer continuing the conversation from here: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/57707.

was working on adding the new `logPath` functionality to an extension of mine, but the documentation was very confusing, and I'm not able to use it for my purpose. Bases on the current wording, it seemed like each extension would get a unique directory, and this directory would be the same across VS Code invocations. However, through testing, I am getting a unique directory per time VS Code is opened. Can this be cleared up in the documentation? It makes a major difference in the usefulness of the API."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/58713","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/58713/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/58713/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/58713/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/58713","id":360409868,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNjA0MDk4Njg=","number":58713,"title":"Change bracket match functionality","user":{"login":"jabacchetta","id":12591890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTkxODkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/12591890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jabacchetta","html_url":"https://github.com/jabacchetta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jabacchetta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jabacchetta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jabacchetta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jabacchetta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jabacchetta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jabacchetta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jabacchetta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jabacchetta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jabacchetta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":403743296,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MDM3NDMyOTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-bracket-matching","name":"editor-bracket-matching","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":272689392,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODkzOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"dcdcdc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMTQxMjEyNA==","number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODcwNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":1680,"closed_issues":5342,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2019-10-14T16:35:16Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-09-14T18:31:47Z","updated_at":"2019-08-08T09:07:22Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Matching brackets have always bothered me in Visual Studio Code and I finally realized what it is: they are shown when inside the brackets **in addition to** being shown when outside of the brackets.\r\n\r\nThis gives an unfavorable visual effect for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. It's not consistent. Your cursor position being on the left or right of a bracket set, will have different results depending on if brackets are nested.\r\n2. More importantly, it's distracting when you **a)** click inside of empty parens **b)** update an argument inside of parens (screenshot below).\r\n\r\nPreferably, matching brackets would only show when the cursor is outside of those matching brackets. This reduces unnecessary distractions and also makes nested brackets more consistent.

This is my first PR and I'd like to get feedback on my general approach before I dig any deeper. \r\n\r\nI know that the particular configurations of my key bindings can be improved and I don't know what `case State.Details` represents. Feedback and help appreciated here! \r\n\r\nMore generally, is the new function `selectNthSuggestion` ok? What about the for loop to go through and add the bindings? How's the id for the key binding? \r\n\r\nPlease be as honest as possible as it's my first PR and I'd like to learn quickly!
