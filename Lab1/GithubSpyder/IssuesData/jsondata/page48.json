Summary\r\nSome actions can cause extensions to be reloaded without the whole window being reloaded. This results in WebViews opened by extensions to remain open. On its own not a problem, except should these use the message API to \"talk\" to their extension, since it got reloaded/terminated. Expected behavior is to close all WebViews, similar to what happens when the window is reloaded, e.g. using the `Developer: Reload Window` command.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce on your own\r\n1. Have an extension launch a WebView\r\n2. Change the \"main workspace folder\" without triggering a window reload\r\nI discovered this by my extension using `updateWorkspaceFolders` to go from 0 to 1 folders.\r\nHaving a multi-folder workspace, rightclicking the first folder, and using `Remove Folder from Workspace` also triggers this effect. So does pressing `Reload` after installing a (new) .vsix for an already installed extension, but that results in an empty WebView?\r\n3. The WebView remains, working, but the extensions reloaded, \"breaking\" `onDidReceiveMessage`\r\n\r\n### With [example extension](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19O86YV-_IWptsLu-894k6fEfvWf-fHmK/view) to easily replicate\r\n*(source code available by opening the file as an archive, or doing step 4 below)*\r\n1. Open a new window (and install the extension if you haven't yet)\r\n2. Run the `ISSUE: Open a test WebView` command\r\n3. Click `Send message` and notice how you get a response from the extension\r\n4. Run the `ISSUE: Add/remove the first workspace folder to trigger the semi-reload` command\r\nIf you had folders in your workspace, the first one gets removed. If your workspace is empty, it'll add the extension's folder (with source code) as workspace folder.\r\n5. Click `Send message` and notice how you don't get a response anymore\r\n\r\n_____\r\n\r\n- VSCode versions tested: \r\n\t- 1.32.3 (user setup) (a3db5be9)\r\n\t- 1.33.0-insider (user setup) (5a88160c)\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10 Version 1803 (OS Build 17134.407)\r\n\r\n> If the first workspace folder is added, removed or changed, the currently executing extensions (including the one that called this method) will be terminated and restarted so that the (deprecated) rootPath property is updated to point to the first workspace folder.\r\n***From the documentation of vscode.workspace.updateWorkspaceFolders***\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/70627","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/70627/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/70627/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/70627/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/70627","id":421848884,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MjE4NDg4ODQ=","number":70627,"title":"Word

Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nWord wrap get wrong line length calculated while these characters are present in line:\r\nU+2018[**`‘`**](Left Single Quotation Mark)\r\nU+2019[**`’`**](Right Single Quotation Mark)\r\nU+201C[**`“`**](Left Double Quotation Mark)\r\nU+201D[**`”`**](Right Double Quotation Mark)\r\n\r\nThese characters are wide characters and should take 2 alphabet characters' width, also known as fullwidth characters, they are different from U+0027['](Apostrophe) and U+0022[\"](Quotation Mark) which are narrow characters(halfwidth characters), see references below.\r\n\r\nIt looks like VSCode calculated these characters as narrow, thus while a long line with 2 or more these characters before wrap position, there will be 1 or more characters stay on the original line so that they are overlapped and covered by scroll bar.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce  this issue:\r\n1. Press Ctrl+N to create a new file\r\n2. Press Alt+Z to enable word wrap\r\n3. Input some text like `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ`\r\n4. Paste the character above(anyone of them) multiple times at line beginning until line end reaches scroll bar\r\n5. Keep pasting and you can see that the characters at line end was covered by scroll bar\r\n6. Press Ctrl+F and toggle replace mode, replace the pasted character with **2 ASCII characters**, you can see that the word wrap is working correctly now and no character is overlapped by scroll bar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences: **`Unicode® Standard Annex #11 - EAST ASIAN

And since the new settings ui became the default, I've seen an uptick in users running into many issues trying to find settings. \r\n\r\nTo combat this (and really this was long before there was even a settings ui), GitLens provides its own built-in settings editor which is highly tailored and interactive to help guide users. But users have a very hard time discovering it. And again since the settings ui became the default users think that the vscode settings ui is the same as GitLens' settings editor, even when I explicitly provide the command to be run from the palette.\r\n\r\nGiven the above, I would *really* love a way from the vscode settings ui, extension page, etc, to at least advertise (or better yet replace/block the built-in ui) and direct people to GitLens' settings editor.

When looking at the changes it seems text I type in one files sometimes get randomly inserted in another open file. One example is I just changed a True to a False in one file and immediatly saw False in the middle of a word in anther file: \"current_step_ruFalsenning\". Sometimes the same word is inserted multiple places using multiple cursors. When pressing ctrl+z my curser is now at all the places the text was inserted. I disabled extensions using code --disable-extensions, to see if it was an extensions problem, but that didn't make a difference. I am unable to figure out how to reproduce this.

However getting function signature is an expensive operation in comparison to just getting the symbol and its range - getting symbol name and range is an operation that works on parsing result (fast for most languages) while getting signature requires type checking results (slower for most languages) which makes whole situation bit problematic. \r\n\r\nThe only current solution is to wait for the type check results - to provide all the info to the DocumentSymbol, however, this obviously may have an impact on general UX (and I'd like to avoid that). Additionally, @jrieken said in https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/61104#issuecomment-430905954 that he suggests making provider as fast as possible.\r\n\r\nIn principle this is similar to the CodeLens API - getting location should be as fast as possible (as it has a huge impact on the UX) and getting detailed info put into CodeLens can take a bit longer.  \r\n\r\nSo my suggestion/feature request/call for help would be adding an additional function that would allow us to update existing DocumentSymbols after they've been initially loaded.

would be great if there was a way to add new tree nodes into the SCM repo view. For example, today there are \"root\" nodes for \"Staged Changes\" and \"Changes\", but I'd love for GitLens (or others) to be able to add new root node(s) to provide its repo explorer, etc. This would provide greater linkage between additional GitLens functionality directly with the built-in SCM functionality -- which imo would be a user-experience win for users. The same could be said for the GitHub PR extension.\r\n\r\nTaking the idea a step further, it would be very cool, if any extension could add other \"root\" nodes to a view -- maybe only if the view contribution explicitly allows it. Granted this would open up new avenues for clutter, but I'd argue we have that clutter today just spread around more and more disconnected.

Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\n~~In the SCM sidebar the behavior of repo multi-select has seem to change in the recent insiders. Previously in 1.32.2, the order of the repo multi-select would determine the order of the repos shown. Now the order seems to always be the same (almost alphabetic but not) which feels like a step backward. If the desire it to be more consistent and deterministic, I would suggest using the same order they are in the \"master\" view as that is the order of the workspace folders (which is controllable by the user).~~\r\n\r\n~~I do like that is now remembers the multi-selection when reloading a workspace now though.~~\r\n\r\nI just wish each repo view had the branch/status info in its title. It would also be great if there was a way to have an auto-collapse/expand mode on each repo -- like a 3rd state (not expanded or collapsed) which would stay collapsed while there were no changes in the repo but would auto-expand when there were.\r\n\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code - Insiders 1.33.0-insider (7258b995f63827ff1b179f47722e500296d64c35, 2019-03-14T06:19:44.881Z)\r\nOS version:

too).\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/70483","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/70483/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/70483/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/70483/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/70483","id":421017285,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MjEwMTcyODU=","number":70483,"title":"Can't
