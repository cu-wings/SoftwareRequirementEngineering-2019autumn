Shift+Right Click on VSCode \r\n2. Click \"Run As Different User\" (The UAC Prompt will not show as it's supposed to.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes\r\n\r\nI ran this on my normal laptop, running Windows 10 1809. Uninstalled VSCode and deleted all related files about 5 times thinking it was me. Finally ran it on my admin jump box which is running Windows 10 1803 and never had VSCode installed on it. I downloaded the newest version from the website and it still doesn't work. I can run all other programs as a different user just fine, that's why I think it's a VSCode bug.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Also just tested and can't even click \"Run As Administrator\"\r\n\r\nEDIT 2: Also tested forcing the runas through powershell window and it doesn't launch as the desired user.

observations:\r\n\r\n- Both the list highlight and the filter box in the top-right are based on `editor.findMatchHighlightBackground`, but the filter box is far darker\r\n- The filter box has a 45 degree drop shadow, I don't think we do this anywhere\r\n- The filter box has rounded edges\r\n- The icons are very blurry and not vertically aligned\r\n- The filter options were very difficult to discover, I would not have come across them if I wasn't testing the feature\r\n\r\nThis is a similar UI component we have which maybe we should copy some style

VSCode Version: 1.30.2, 1.31.0\r\n- OS Version: macOS High Sierra\r\n\r\nI was looking for a setting that I was sure must be there. The key words were \"markdown tab size\" and in retrospect, I was looking for this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  // Whether to use different indentation sizes on different context\r\n  //  - adaptive: Use 2 spaces for unordered list and 3 for the ordered\r\n  //  - inherit: Use the configured tab size of the current document (see vscode status bar)\r\n  \"markdown.extension.list.indentationSize\": \"adaptive\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll three search terms appear in this snippet. However, VSCode doesn't find it:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"772\" alt=\"screenshot 2019-01-29 at 13 44 06\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152/51909542-340c4d00-23cd-11e9-90f0-321f6b0e7a80.png\">\r\n\r\nIs it because the term \"tab size\" is only in a value description? In any case, from a human point of view, the setting should almost certainly come up with the search terms I'm using, right?
