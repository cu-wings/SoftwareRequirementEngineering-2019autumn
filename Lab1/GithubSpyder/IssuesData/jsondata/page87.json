But quite often, I don't want to edit all matches in the file - I may only want to edit those in the current function or block.  It gets a bit painful to select these with the mouse.\r\n\r\nI think a great (and easily implemented?) feature would be to be able to successively select matching sequences above or below my original selection with a key combination - say `Ctrl-Shft-Down` or `Ctrl-Shft-Up`.\r\n\r\nFor example, I have a function with 10 instances of the string `isValid` in it.  I want to edit them all, but not the other instances of `isValid` in the file.  With this feature implemented, I could:\r\n\r\n1. Select the first instance of `isValid` in the function\r\n1. Press `Ctrl-Shft-Down` nine times\r\n1.

 \"sort lines ascending\" sorts alphabetically caseinsensitive.\r\nWhile this makes sense most of the time, there are case where a more specific ordering would be preferable,\r\n\r\n## Example: Sass/CSS ordering\r\n\r\nwhen sorting in Sass/Css files, the current sorting order is a counter intuitive:\r\n```\r\nborder: ...\r\nborder-radius: ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill become\r\n```\r\nborder-radius: ...\r\nborder: ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecause it orders '-' before ':' but in this specific case, it's preferable to go from generic to specific, i.e. ordering border before border-radius.\r\n\r\nwith a way to provide a custom sort function (or have some to choose from) would allow to get this way of sorting\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/53200","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/53200/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/53200/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/53200/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/53200","id":336459441,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMzY0NTk0NDE=","number":53200,"title":"Option

I have a three suggestions for styling tabs that I feel would improve the UX of the editor and allow themes to be more internally consistent.\r\n\r\n* `tab.hoverForeground` to style the foreground color of a tab. Currently `tab.hoverBackground` exists but not foreground. I think this would be useful because in my theme — spacegray — I want the hover style in the sidebar to match the hover style in the tabs. Currently, on sidebar hover, the foreground color lightens.\r\n* `tab.closeForeground`, which would style the color of the close button. I don't currently see this anywhere but if I've missed it, please let me know\r\n* `tab.closeHoverForeground`, which would style the color of the close button on hover Per [this comment](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30901#issuecomment-350197809) by @bpasero, hover states for the close button were not seen useful but I would argue a close button is an ideal use case for hover-state feedback. When switching tabs, a user could accidentally click on the close button instead of the tab hit area and accidentally close that tab. If the close button turns a different color on hover, it is very clear that a click will close the tab.\r\n\r\n**Update:**\r\n* Allow `tab.unfocusedActiveBackground` in `workbench.colorCustomizations` #54197\r\n* Have separate colors for active and inactive tab hover

had a user [report an issue](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/610) with Visual Studio Live Share, where their HTML tag-closing behavior would insert duplicate closing tags as soon as a guest connected to their session.\r\n\r\n![doubleaddingendtags](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1142313/41826432-7d63e1c0-77f7-11e8-9155-1f2d42fcbc4d.gif)\r\n\r\nAfter looking into it briefly, it appears like the [HTML tag-closing behavior](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/extensions/html-language-features/client/src/tagClosing.ts) is [listening to the `workspace.onDidChangeTextDocument` event](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/extensions/html-language-features/client/src/tagClosing.ts#L12:12), and therefore, generating the closing tag on every participants machine, as soon as the `/` or `>` is synchronized across the session. If five guests joined the session, then you'd see six copies of the closing tag.\r\n\r\nIt isn't immediately clear what the best fix for this is, so I was hoping to get some advice. Initially, I thought we could set the `html.autoClosingTags` setting to `false` in the guest's workspace file. However, since the tag-closing behavior [relies on the `activeEditor`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/extensions/html-language-features/client/src/tagClosing.ts#L58), this would break tag-closing for guests if they weren't focused on the same file as the host (maybe that's a better short-term solution?).\r\n\r\nAt a high-level, it seems like there are two possible ways to address to:\r\n\r\n1. **Run the tag-closing logic on the host** - Live Share already takes \"exclusive\" ownership of language services for `vsls:` documents, but the tag-closing logic runs on the guest's machine since it appears to be [always initialized](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/extensions/html-language-features/client/src/htmlMain.ts#L90) regardless of the document scheme. We could explore ways to run this logic on the host, however, the reliance on the `activeEditor` would need to be refactored.\r\n\r\n2. **Run the tag-closing logic local to each participant** - Since the tag-closing logic could operate entirely on a document buffer, it could technically just run on each guest's machine, without needing file system access. However, since it relies on the `workspace.onDidChangeChangeTextDocument` event, it seems like it would need to identify \"local\" edits, and only generate closing tags as appropriate. That way, each guest doesn't create the same edit that everyone else is already making.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts would be greatly appreciated, since the current behavior is definitely a little wonky.

Have a launch.json, tasks.json and package.json with the content as seen in Ex3\r\n2. Run `Launch Client` in the debug menu. Two terminals are opened, one for watch:server and one for watch:client, as well as the new VSCode window \r\n3.

The focus then changes to the `Output` tab, Ex2 is shown, and Ex1 is seen in the developer tools\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf I open vscode extension host client multiple times, it naturally spawns 2*n terminals, as there are 2 watchers. Only every second terminal closed seems to cause the issue aka if I have 4 open, only the 2nd and 4th terminal closed will cause the issue, the order they were started in is irrelevant.  \r\n\r\nEx1:

think having 'sticky' code windows at the top and bottom of editors which display a subset of contextually relevant lines of code that are currently out of view could be a very powerful feature.\r\n\r\nThe logic for identifying these contextually relevant lines could rely on existing code folding identification, which would also make it useful for languages like HTML to identify where the user is within a large tree of tags.\r\n\r\nThe biggest use case would be displaying all of the namespace, class, function, etc. headers and closing brackets, like in the following mockup.\r\n\r\n![mockup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8853194/41813353-19dbd5a2-76fa-11e8-883f-b414438154b8.PNG)\r\n\r\nThese code windows should allow simple in-place editing, similar to the Peek Definition or Find All References code windows.\r\n\r\nIf there are too many lines to comfortably fit the code window, the windows could either become scroll-able or Code could display only the N lines closest to the current viewport.\r\n\r\nThe sections could also potentially be used for displaying other things like Find/Replace results or lines containing metadata. Language extensions could potentially contribute additional code spans they think are contextually relevant.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to #41666 but larger and more flexible in scope. It might have similar use cases to #9418.\r\n\r\nI would argue that having the actual code for the hierarchy be visible and editable would make it easier for the user to \"find their place\" at a glance, as well as to make revisions to those lines, e.g. revising parameter signatures while working within a large function
