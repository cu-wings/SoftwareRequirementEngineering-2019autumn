have searched around using keywords \"hand cursor\" but seems no one has raised the same issue.\r\n\r\nProposal\r\n--------\r\n\r\nI propose that, the \"Hand Cursor\" should not be used everywhere, e.g. over a button, over a tab, etc.\r\n\r\nInstead, \r\n\r\n1. the UI elements (e.g. a button) should be more affordable, and\r\n2. a normal \"Arrow\" cursor should be used.\r\n\r\nReason\r\n--------\r\n\r\nBecause it violates both [Microsoft's Windows Desktop Apps Design Guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/uxguide/inter-mouse) and [Apple's macOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/user-interaction/mouse-and-trackpad/). Though VSCode is built on top of Web stack, it's still a Desktop App I believe.\r\n\r\n#### Violation 1: Buttons/Tabs should be affordable\r\n\r\nIn [Microsoft's Windows Desktop Apps Design Guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/uxguide/inter-mouse), it states that:\r\n> Well-designed user interface (UI) objects are said to have affordance, which are visual and behavioral properties of an object that suggest how it is used. \r\n\r\nApparently, most buttons in VSCode (think of the NewFile/NewFolder buttons in Explorer sidebar, as well as the buttons in Debug sidebar) are not affordable enough. They don't look like a button, and also doesn't have a hover effect.\r\n\r\n#### Violation 2: \"Arrow Cursor\" should be used the most commonly\r\n\r\nIn [Microsoft's Windows Desktop Apps Design Guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/uxguide/inter-mouse):\r\n> Normal select - Used for most objects.\r\nLink select - Used for text and graphics links because of their weak affordance.\r\n\r\nIn [Apple's macOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/user-interaction/mouse-and-trackpad/):\r\n>  Arrow - This is the standard pointer thatâ€™s used to select and interact with content and interface elements.\r\nPointing hand - The content beneath the pointer is a URL link to a webpage, document, or other item.\r\n\r\nIn both guidelines, the usage of \"Hand\" cursor is very limited. Only when we are pointing to a URL/Text Link/Graphics Link, it should be used.\r\n\r\nPeople are trying to be \"Native\" when using Web stack to build Mobile Apps. We should do the same on Desktop Apps.\r\n\r\nElectron Apps that follows these guidance\r\n--------\r\n[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). It uses Arrow cursor for buttons, tabs, dropdowns etc. which is coincident with how native apps do.\r\n\r\n[Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/). Not fully follows the guidance, but many parts (listbox, tabs, toolbar , etc) do."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/55307","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/55307/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/55307/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/55307/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/55307","id":345466272,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNDU0NjYyNzI=","number":55307,"title":"Make

was checked from the main process, which had it set depending on if the *first* launch of VS Code was launched from cli or not, instead of whether the *current* launch has it set.\r\n\r\nSo I changed the check to checking the `userEnv` passed to the new browser window.\r\n\r\nNote that the assignment of `lazyEnv` and `userEnv` into `process.env` was racing before! Which is a bug in and of itself. After this fix, the `shellEnv`/`lazyEnv` overrides the passed in `userEnv`, but that can be changed later if needed.\r\n\r\nWe are also always launching the shell now since `configuration.userEnv` is not available yet when `lazyEnv` is initialized. It will require a hack or some refactoring to fix, so I left that like this for now.

I'll just be going about my day, using CMD+S to save my files. Randomly, I'll notice that there are still grey dots next to file names, because the file hasn't been saved in a while. CMD+S stopped working. Running it through the command palette is fine.\r\n\r\nI remove the mapping for the save action to CMD+S and restart VSCode, and go to remap the action again to CMD+S. VSCode refuses to type the letter \"S\" into the keybindings window. I have no idea why, but it happens.\r\n\r\n![Gif](https://cl.ly/tEdE/Screen%20Recording%202018-07-25%20at%2005.00%20PM.gif)\r\n\r\nHere's the kicker; other keyboard shortcuts (like Save As) that include CMD+S+<another modifier> work _fine_. It's driving me insane.\r\n\r\nA full restart of my machine resolves it. This happened today with the two options specified via the command line (for monitor flicker issues), but it happens with normal starts of VSCode too.\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.25.1
