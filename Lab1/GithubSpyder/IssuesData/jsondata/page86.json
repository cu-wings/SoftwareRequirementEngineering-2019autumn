At the moment, this includes input and output files from the extension running. I want to also be able to diff compare the output to the correct output on just a click from the terminal.\r\nIn order to use vscode's awesome diff editor, I have to launch it programmatically. So that's where this feature idea came from. If I was able to create links in the output panel that run a vscode command, I could then launch the diff editor on the appropriate files.\r\nI can also see why you wouldn't want someone to launch commands from the output panel as a fear of unknown code execution.\r\n### Background\r\nI'm working on an extension for personal use designed as a test runner for competitive programming. The gist of it is that I create test cases from input and output files and can run on multiple languages with the output to the output panel.

Do either one of these steps:\r\n    - Copy the following code in a blank document that VS Code supports code folding in.\r\n    - Create a JavaScript document, and save it as \"foo.js\" anywhere.\r\n2. Copy the following code in (or create whatever code you can be syntactically correct in, and it has to have at least 5 lines of codes):\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction foo() {\r\n\tvar create1 = document.querySelector(\"div\");\r\n\tvar create2 = document.querySelector(\"div\");\r\n\tvar create3 = document.querySelector(\"div\");\r\n\tvar create4 = document.querySelector(\"div\");\r\n\tvar create5 = document.querySelector(\"div\");\r\n\tvar create6 = document.querySelector(\"div\");\r\n\tvar create7 = document.querySelector(\"div\");\r\n\tvar create8 = document.querySelector(\"div\");\r\n\tvar create9 = document.querySelector(\"div\");\r\n\tvar create10 = document.querySelector(\"div\");\r\n\tvar create11 = document.querySelector(\"div\");\r\n\tvar create12 = document.querySelector(\"div\");\r\n\tvar create13 = document.querySelector(\"div\");\r\n\tvar create14 = document.querySelector(\"div\");\r\n\tvar create15 = document.querySelector(\"div\");\r\n\tvar create16 = document.querySelector(\"div\");\r\n\tvar create17 = document.querySelector(\"div\");\r\n\tvar create18 = document.querySelector(\"div\");\r\n\t//... \r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. Fold the code function, `foo`, so it is folded like so:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6444116/42462134-574c1bd6-8370-11e8-9aaa-78889db18bff.png)\r\n4. Click outside of Visual Studio Code, so Visual Studio Code is inactive (out-of-focus).\r\n5. Click on the right side of the left bracket on the line, `foo() {`, in Visual Studio Code. (Basically, clicking on the empty space, so the line indicator is highlighting the beginning of the code-folded line and the text cursor is at the end of the line).\r\n6. Observe that `foo` gets expanded upon first click, when the correct behavior should be the operating system switching context to Visual Studio Code, and consume the mouse click event without doing anything else.\r\n\r\nHere's a GIF in action:\r\n\r\n![gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6444116/42462427-3d528bce-8371-11e8-9849-65f0fc352848.gif)\r\n\r\nIf we have a list of code-folded functions, and all the user wanted to do was to go back to Visual Studio Code and scroll the document up/down, the user may inadvertently unfold the code, and it would annoy the user to re-fold the code back before continuing to scroll.\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/53885","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/53885/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/53885/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/53885/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/53885","id":339516036,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMzk1MTYwMzY=","number":53885,"title":"Dynamic

only only allow us the option to select the entire word, `camelCase`, in the editor.\r\n\r\nWith the release of VSCode 1.25, we now have the option to select subwords using keyboard navigation ([See here](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_25#_history-navigation)). \r\n\r\nFor example, we can use new keybindings to move the cursor between each subword within words (e.g. `camel` and `Case` in `camelCase`).\r\n\r\nAs-is, double-clicking functionality is still less robust, only giving us the option to highlight the entire word without respecting special casing like that in camelCase, which is extremely common in most codebases.\r\n\r\nIt would be awesome if we could have an option extending the new subword selection functionality to also work with double-clicking in order to make functionality consistently robust between these two modes of text selection.\r\n\r\nP.S.

should improve Node auto attach in the following ways:\r\n\r\n1.

It's my understanding that the StatusBarAction was added due to a performance concern on Windows, which have been resolved. \r\n\r\nThe rationale is to make it a global setting, and declutter the already full statusbar. This would also enable a workspace setting to override for a specific project, and enable users to toggle this once.\r\n\r\n2.

am going to ask is huge. I know it might take a lot of work. It is not a small thing but very important for me.\r\n\r\nI am using VS Code from day one. And during that time I have few OS reinstalled and one PC change. Every time when that happens I need to install all plugins and configure VS Code again.\r\n\r\nNow I've realized that I use VS Code without reinstall for quite a while. \r\n\r\n1. I have pretty much nice setup, which was made through 1-2 years. But I do not remember all changes I made in configuration or all extensions. I remember one day accidentally I found an article that recommended to use some cool font, I followed procedure to install and activate it. Also I've went through so many themes before I've found the one I like.\r\n\r\n   But if my PC crashes, I am not sure I'll ever get back to the same setup. Because I do not remember all extensions I have now, and where to look the name of that font and how to activate it. I do not remember name of the theme. So PC crush it will be pretty much devastating experience in terms of IDE setup.\r\n\r\n2. I have PC at work and at home and laptop. I have VS Code installed everywhere, I often jump between PCs doing same job and sync through github. But my setup is different on every PC. And it is not something that I like. I cannot find that cool article about that cool font. So I just resigned that this is how it works. Sometimes I want to run a tool and discover it is not here because I did not yet installed it on this VS Code instance.\r\n\r\n3. Sometimes I have to code few lined on the PC of other people as a supervisor. But setup of those users completely turn me off. I just cannot work on their color theme and without tools I love and depend on.\r\n\r\n4. VS Code become a very advanced, versatile and flexible tool. МЫ Code setup for PHP developer looks and feel different then setup of JS developer or Markdown writer. For instance when I edit markdown files I want wrap lines at 80, when edit JS files I want to wrap limes at 160. And so on.\r\n \r\n**feature request**\r\n\r\nAllow users lo login to VS Code with live ID, and create cloud profile, and VS code not only restore configuration, key map, themes but also installs all extensions I have. If I install something new on PC one, when I open PC two it will automatically update. Also user can create few profiles for example one for working with PHP with needed extensions and theme, another for documentation work with markdown and such. not only user can restore environment, user can have different environments and quickly switch between them.\r\n\r\nSo I could have uniform experience, where ever I am. Even if I am in internet cafe on the edge of the universe, just install VS Code to write few lines, login, and here we are, MY VS Code. My. Only my, exactly like it was last time i'd opened it on the other edge of the universe. \r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/53444","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/53444/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/53444/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/53444/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/53444","id":337512610,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMzc1MTI2MTA=","number":53444,"title":"Share find clipboard across workspaces","user":{"login":"NorthboundTrain","id":2432691,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzI2OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2432691?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NorthboundTrain","html_url":"https://github.com/NorthboundTrain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NorthboundTrain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NorthboundTrain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NorthboundTrain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NorthboundTrain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NorthboundTrain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NorthboundTrain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NorthboundTrain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NorthboundTrain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NorthboundTrain/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":398766855,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzOTg3NjY4NTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-find","name":"editor-find","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":272689392,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODkzOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"dcdcdc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-07-02T13:12:21Z","updated_at":"2018-09-04T23:55:58Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I'd like to be able to share the find text between different workspaces.

Type: <b>Feature Request</b>\r\n\r\nRecently I had a problem with my ISP that all resources hosted on Microsoft servers were inaccessible for me. The error was simple — \"Connection timed out\".\r\n\r\nBut I noticed that VS Code doesn't directly tell if, for example, it fails to check updates because of this, instead, it just says \"There are currently no updates available.\", which is a quite untruthful message. \r\n\r\nBetter, if it would tell when some action fails because the resource is inaccessible.\r\nFor example, if you run update check manually, after it fails, it would say \"The update server is currently inaccessible. Check your network connection.\".\r\n\r\nThis all also applies for extensions installation — same *hilarious* situation: \"Error: Failed to install 'msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome'. [Download Manually]\".\r\nUntil I figured out that Microsoft resources are unavailable for me, I thought it's problem with my VS Code installation or config files.

The language I am developing it for usually comes with either its own file extension (let's call it `.myext`) or simply `.txt` (it's just a scripting language).\r\n\r\nI have run into the issue that I am not sure how to tell VS Code to only use my plugin when the first line matches a specific string when opening `.txt` files. Afaik, this is currently not possible (hence the _feature request_). I have not found any information that tells me otherwise and the [contribution points](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/extension-points#_contributeslanguages) article does not go into details about how exactly VS Code chooses a language mode when applying the three mentioned rules.\r\n\r\nFrom what I have read [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10915) and [here](https://github.com/PranayAgarwal/vscode-hack/issues/1), there have been some changes last year that allow language plugins that match the file extension __and__ the first line of a file to get precedence over a plugin that just matches one of the two. But this does not seem to work with any built-in language modes. As soon as I set a file extension match for `.txt` (or other file extensions I do not have specific plugins installed for) in my plugin, VS Code __always__ activates my plugin when opening such a file and disregards the _first line_ match I have also set up specifically to make sure VS Code does not activate my plugin for \"any old\" `.txt` file.\r\n\r\nWhat I think should happen is that when my plugin is the only one that contributes to `.txt` files and I have a file extension match __and__ a _first line_ match set up, these two matches should behave like a logical `AND` (`&&`); only if both are `true`, VS Code should use my extension over the built-in language mode for _plain text_. The more sophisticated solution would probably be to let the plugin developer choose if he wants to apply a `AND` or an `OR` rule to these matches. Or a weight-based system as described in #10915.\r\n\r\nI hope it is somewhat clear what the issue is. If not, let me know and I will provide an example extension that demonstrates what I am talking about."}]
