friends,\r\n\r\nreplacing a regex in a small file works fine, whereas doing so on a large file (originally 5.5M lines) results in incorrect behaviour 100% of time.\r\n\r\nI have tried the steps below with the current VSCode release, the insiders build, and again the current release with extensions disabled, all on Win10 with the same (deterministic) result.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->\r\n<!-- Also please test using the latest insiders build to make sure your issue has not already been fixed: https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/

Date: 2018-11-04T13:04:20.759Z\r\n- Electron: 2.0.12\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Download, unzip, and open the [small file](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/files/2552357/odstavec_closing_tag_untouched.vert.txt) (29 lines) and the [large one](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/files/2552322/odstavec_closing_tag_cleared.zip) (6.3 M lines, 100 MiB), in which the content of the small file is simply duplicated more than 200,000 times. _The files contain vertical text: the first attested (Old) Czech sentence represented in tab-separated values wrapped in XML-like tags, a part of a text corpus._\r\n2. Observe that on the small file, replacing the regex ^([^\\t<]+).*$ with $1 works correctly. _The regex is supposed to strip annotation from non-XML lines (i.e. keep only the first column):_\r\n\r\n **_a\ta|a|a\t\tk0|k8|k9_**\r\n Sedlatu\r\n .\r\n &lt;/odstavec&gt;\r\n &lt;/folio&gt;\r\n\r\nbecomes\r\n\r\n **_a_**\r\n Sedlatu\r\n .\r\n &lt;/odstavec&gt;\r\n &lt;/folio&gt;\r\n\r\n3. On the large file, not only the annotation is removed; lines with closing tags (&lt;/odstavec&gt;) which immediately follow _affected_ lines are cleared as well:\r\n\r\n **_a_**\r\n Sedlatu\r\n .\r\n **[line cleared]**\r\n &lt;/folio&gt;\r\n\r\nThank you for resolving this issue!\r\n\r\nPS: 7-Zip compresses the 100 MiB file to a 15 KiB archive, ZIP creates a 447 KiB

Type: Feature Request\r\nRelevant Issues: There was one but I'm unable to find it, this is an idea to perhaps explore it. Maybe the bot can find it.\r\n\r\n## Live Editor Theming\r\nThe original issue puts forward the idea of live editing a theme, such that when a change is applied, it's applied automatically without reloads and allows the developee to see what exactly changed. There are still a few downsides that I feel this feature request would solve. But before I explain, I'll describe my idea to push it further.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Idea In-depth\r\nMy plan is to perhaps be able to have a 'Theme Dev Mode' of some sorts where the editor is put into a 'frozen' state (by this, I don't mean a 'Not Responding' state, but rather you can't type, UI actions don't do anything but are toggleable, basically a disabled state) and devs are able to click on various UI elements or scopes to open a pop up detailing all the possible relevant scopes that can be defined.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to the current `Developer: Inspect TM Scopes` but adds in support for UI too, and would be part of the 'live' experience\r\n\r\n## How would this benefit developers\r\nThe original issue stated that it would help theme developers (the live theme idea in general), and I believe this notion. would. boost the efficiency further. Currently many devs probably go to the docs to find their relevant UI scope, but this could be made easier as the pop ups detailed here could also be powered by docs. \r\n\r\n## Issues this specific idea would solve\r\n(relating to this idea, not necessarily the original issue)\r\n\r\n- Time consumed searching for scopes\r\n- Much more friendly towards new devs\r\n\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- May be hard to implement, though the 'disabled' state is one thatvs started groundwork in the Walkthrough on the Welcome

VSCode Version: 1.28.2\r\n- OS Version: macOS High Sierra 10.13.5\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Assign a shortcut to stage and revert change when dirtyDiffVisible.  Below is what I had in my keybindings.json file.\r\n```javascript\r\n    {\r\n        \"key\": \"alt+cmd+a\",\r\n        \"command\": \"git.stageChange\",\r\n        \"when\": \"dirtyDiffVisible\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"key\": \"alt+cmd+z\",\r\n        \"command\": \"git.revertChange\",\r\n        \"when\": \"dirtyDiffVisible\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Load a file with some unstaged changes.  Use command `Show next change` from the command palette to go to next change and bring up dirty diff view.  When evoking the shortcut to either stage or revert the change, the following error message pops up \"Git: Cannot read property 'toString' of undefined\"\r\n\r\nClicking the buttons manually doesn't produce the issue, but using the keyboard shortcut does.  As you can see from the screenshot, it seems like vscode has correctly mapped the action to the shortcut.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"206\" alt=\"screenshot 2018-11-04 01 19 15\"

For whatever mental reason I, and i'm guessing others, find these really confusing given historically we are used to seeing keyboard shortcuts involving use of Shift key listed as Ctrl+Shift+... and Alt+Shift+....  My recommendation here is that the 1/2 dozen Shift+Alt+... entries i'm seeing in these keyboard shortcut references be updated to use the more expected Alt+Shift+... format unless there was an intentional reason for using non-typical ordering.\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.28.2 (7f3ce96ff4729c91352ae6def877e59c561f4850, 2018-10-17T00:23:51.859Z)\r\nOS version: Windows_NT x64

I'm having problems telling the UI that execution has been resumed after hitting breakpoint or pausing. I seem to be missing some step, but I checked examples, other debug adapters and can't even find that part there. My current flow is this:\r\n\r\n1. Set breakpoint (this works fine, breakpoint is sent to my runtime)\r\n2. Breakpoint is hit, my runtime sends back info and trggers `new StoppedEvent('breakpoint', Const.THREAD_ID)` (this is single thread thing)\r\n3. I haven't yet implemented stack capabilities in runtime so I just return some predefined list of stack trace lines to show them in UI. \r\n4. In debug UI the icon || (Pause) changes to |> (Continue) and other options become available (step etc.)\r\n\r\nAnd here is where I'm encountering problems - I added Continue support:\r\n```\r\nprotected continueRequest(response: DebugProtocol.ContinueResponse, args: DebugProtocol.ContinueArguments): void {\r\n\t\tthis._remoteProcess.continue();\r\n\t\tthis.sendResponse(response);\r\n\t} \r\n```\r\nwhich sends command to runtime to resume execution. This works but the UI still shows |> icon and looks like if it was in stopped state. I tried sending `ContinuedEvent` but no luck here. I'm out of ideas what is responsible for telling UI that the execution continues and reflect that by showing back Pause buttons and greying out step functions. \r\n\r\nIt's even worse with Pausing, because while breakpoint stop allows me to continue, after pausing the flow it'll still stay in || (Pause) mode for UI, so I can't resume from here. I think I miss information on what it is that decides what UI is displayed. I followed examples, but maybe something simple is missing here... \r\nAlso, many times Pause just won't work - I click it but there is no `pauseRequest` being sent, which gives me some hint that maybe VS is not in a state where it expects pause? This is output from the logger:\r\n```\r\nFrom client: initialize({\"clientID\":\"vscode\",\"clientName\":\"Visual Studio Code - Insiders\",\"adapterID\":\"angelscript\",\"pathFormat\":\"path\",\"linesStartAt1\":true,\"columnsStartAt1\":true,\"supportsVariableType\":true,\"supportsVariablePaging\":true,\"supportsRunInTerminalRequest\":true,\"locale\":\"en-gb\"})\r\nTo client: {\"seq\":0,\"type\":\"response\",\"request_seq\":1,\"command\":\"initialize\",\"success\":true,\"body\":{\"supportsConfigurationDoneRequest\":true,\"supportsFunctionBreakpoints\":true,\"supportsEvaluateForHovers\":true,\"supportsStepBack\":true,\"supportsRestartFrame\":false}}\r\nFrom

{\"seq\":0,\"type\":\"response\",\"request_seq\":6,\"command\":\"threads\",\"success\":true,\"body\":{\"threads\":[{\"id\":1,\"name\":\"Thread 1\"}]}}\r\n```\r\nand at this point clicking \"Pause\" does not send any request.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this has any useful meaning but I'm only implementing \"Attach\" behaviour, because my runtime is not possible to be launched (it's remotely running process)."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/62435","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/62435/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/62435/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/62435/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/62435","id":376665227,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNzY2NjUyMjc=","number":62435,"title":"Allow

Reproduce:\r\nI search very often a symbol in current active file using by ctrl+shift+o.\r\nI noticed that takes some inaccurate results than Sublime Text in cases like below.\r\n    **symbols with

2)\r\nsetDBook()\r\nsetDefineSome(bool)\r\nonStoreDefineAddressBook()\r\nlet search with such as 'sdb'\r\nthe results :\r\nVS Code =>\r\nonStoreDefineAddressBook()\r\nsetDefineSome(bool)\r\nsetDBook()\r\nSublime Text =>\r\nsetDBook()\r\nonStoreDefineAddressBook()\r\nsetDefineSome(bool)\r\n\r\nwhat I want is setDBook()\r\n\r\nOn the candidates list, It doesn't focus to the symbol in where the cursor is on editor when search box is invoked by ctrl+shift+o, it always get focus at the top element.\r\nSublime Text focus to the symbol in which gets the cursor in editor.\r\nIn my experience, It gets better convenient in Sublime Text.\r\n\r\nI'm new with VS Code, I have used Sublime Text and Eclipse for a few years.\r\nI use always the searching by symbol while work.\r\nI feels a bit more bad than Sublime Text with this feature,\r\nI think this feature should key feature on mention to if not full IDE.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/62430","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/62430/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/62430/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/62430/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/62430","id":376637298,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNzY2MzcyOTg=","number":62430,"title":"Slow

there :wave:\r\n\r\ni ran into a weird one. i have an extension which presents a webview with a number of html button elements. when these buttons are clicked, they often run a command via `executeCommand` which in turn prompts the user via `showInputBox`.\r\n\r\nwhen a user clicks, the button is focused, command is run, and the input box is shown prompting the user to enter some info. they enter text and press the `<enter>` key to submit.\r\n\r\nsince the button on the webview is _still focused_, it receives the `<enter>` key press and re-triggers the command. iow, `<enter>` in the input box is re-routed to the focused html button element.\r\n\r\nideally, focus should be removed from a webview (or any of it's children elements) once the user opens the command palette.\r\n\r\nfor now, i just call `el.blur()` in my webview's event handler which fixes the issue.\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: v1.28.2\r\n- OS Version: macOS v10.13.6 (high
