Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n- Start editing two different files in a source controlled project\r\n- Add a large section to one of the files that spans more than one screen height\r\n- Make any change to the other file so it will appear in the source control panel\r\n- Open the source control panel and click the file with the large added section\r\n- Scroll down partway through the large add section, take note of the cursor position\r\n- Click on the other file in the source control panel\r\n- Now click back on the file with the large added section again\r\n- Observe that the cursor position will have jumped up towards the top of the add section, losing the previous cursor position\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\n- Switching to an already open diff view for a file should not reset the cursor position\r\n- If the diff view was never closed, the last cursor position should be maintained, like any other editor tab\r\n- When a diff view is opened for the first time it should still jump to the first different section (as it already does)\r\n\r\nMotivation:\r\nUsing the Source Control panel with \"Toggle Side by Side View\" off as a replacement for the Explorer panel as a workflow for focusing on currently modified files only. The cursor position being reset when switching back and forth between files diff views is disruptive to this workflow.\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.31.1 (1b8e8302e405050205e69b59abb3559592bb9e60,

Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->\r\nWe currently use Mocha to run all of our tests through the out/ folder within our repository. We want to switch to using ts-node in conjunction with mocha so that we can run the tests and collect coverage information (with NYC) through the typescript files, rather than compiled javscript. This works fine for unit tests, but it doesn't seem to work with vscode-integration tests. I believe due to the way the extension development host is launched, it is looking specifically for a javascript extension so can't interpret our typescript files. \r\nIs it possible to change that so that we are able to also run vscode-integration tests through the typescript files?

VSCode Version: 1.31.1 and 1.32.0-insider\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT x64 10.0.16299\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Obtain the MemFS sample (git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples and then go to the fsprovider-sample subdir)\r\n2. Edit package.json to require a newer version of vscode than the sample's default. I changed ```\"vscode\": \"^1.23.0\"``` to ```\"vscode\": \"^1.31.0\"```. This is necessary in order to get use of the isReadonly option on ```vscode.workspace.registerFileSystemProvider```\r\n3. ```npm install``` in Terminal\r\n4. Edit src/extension.ts to add that ```isReadonly: true``` to the options parameter.\r\n5. F5\r\n6. When Extension Development Host window opens, switch to it, press F1 and run 'MemFS: Setup Workspace', then F1 again and 'MemFS: Create Files'.\r\n7. Switch to Explorer view.\r\n8. Single-click on one of the files, e.g. file.js and observe that the tab caption lacks the '(read-only)' suffix.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6726799/53635715-e24a2300-3c15-11e9-9b1d-80fc8c0f0f76.png)\r\n\r\n9. Try typing into the document and verify it is correctly read-only.\r\n10. Doubleclick on the tab to persist it. The caption now gets the expected '(read-only)' suffix.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6726799/53636076-eb87bf80-3c16-11e9-9281-69fe2c2fa026.png)\r\n\r\nAlso notice the weird doubled-up '(read-only) (read-only)' on  the titlebar. Is this intentional?\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/69650","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/69650/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/69650/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/69650/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/69650","id":416061891,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MTYwNjE4OTE=","number":69650,"title":"Do

Summary\r\nThis pull request implements a lightweight service that registers Visual Studio Code for application restart in Windows. This is only observed when the system reboots itself; usually for a Windows update.\r\n\r\n[Example Here](https://i.imgur.com/0WUn4oA.gifv)\r\n\r\nResolves #12630 \r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n1. Run `yarn gulp vscode-win32-x64` to package the application\r\n1. Navigate to the package output (`..\\VSCode-win32-x64`)\r\n1. Run `Code - OSS.exe`\r\n1. Run `shutdown /g /t 0` to simulate a restart from Windows update.\r\n\r\nThis will only properly work from a packaged version of Visual Studio Code. Having a virtual machine to test in is also useful.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nIn order to use the [`RegisterApplicationRestart`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-registerapplicationrestart) method, I had to create a [Node.js extension](https://github.com/kdelorey/node-windows-register-restart) for the method. I'm happy to transfer ownership of the extension to the Microsoft GitHub organization if required.\r\n\r\nA service was then added that handles the registration of Visual Studio Code for restart. It also hooks into one of the opened code windows to listen for `WM_ENDSESSION`. The `WM_ENDSESSION` is triggered before a shutdown. I use this opportunity to ask the `LifecycleService` to `quit(fromUpdate: true)`. I use the `fromUpdate` argument in order to save all of the opened workspaces into the `storage.json` file.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/69572","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/69572/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/69572/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/69572/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/69572","id":415407517,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MTU0MDc1MTc=","number":69572,"title":"Debugging with no launch config fails when tsc task detection is disabled","user":{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzg3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129993,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTYxMjk5OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"8D6673","default":true},{"id":291054922,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTEwNTQ5MjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/debug","name":"debug","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTgxNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTgxNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2019-02-28T01:42:55Z","updated_at":"2019-02-28T09:02:07Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"- Disable `typescript.tsc.autoDetect`\r\n- Open a .ts file in a workspace with no launch.json\r\n- Start debugging\r\n- Get error `Could not find the task 'tsc: build -

When I scroll up or down through the code, the cursor follows me. That's a nice feature which I didn't notice previously in VS. So fast two fingers swipe on laptop touchbar, makes the cursor scrolling, until it reaches satisfying position (it takes about 1s). The point is that if during the cursor scrolling, we want to switch to another view (for instance web browser) by very popular ALT+TAB shortcut, the cursor (which is still scrolling) catches ALT, and activates ALT+UP/DOWN hotkey. As a result it unexpectedly moves line of code up or down. \r\nIt's really uncomfortable, because we have to wait until the cursor did not stop.\r\n\r\n![vscode_error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11910368/53450050-9d5a9c80-3a1b-11e9-93f7-4381a3f96571.gif)\r\n\n\n_Copied from original issue:
