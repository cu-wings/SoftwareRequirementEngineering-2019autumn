Based on the last comment, I don't believe that the assigned developer completely understood the issue, and\r\n2. I am adding more specific details that would classify it as a bug.\r\n\r\nI frequently use `Ctrl + W` to close the active editor.  When there are no open Windows (i.e. editor tabs) pressing `Ctrl + W` closes the Workspace (i.e. the entire VS Code application) which is not the behavior I want.\r\n\r\nIn the Keyboard Shortcuts menu there are default bindings for `Ctrl + W` to \"Close Window\" and `Ctrl + K + F` to \"Close Workspace\".\r\n\r\nIn Version 1.25.1 when there are no open editors, pressing `Ctrl + W` (wrongly) assumes that I wanted to issue a `Ctrl + K + F` / Close Workspace command.  In this situation the desired behavior is no action as:\r\n\r\n1. There are no open Windows, and \r\n2. The Workspace is not a Window according to the semantics defined in Keyboard Shortcuts.\r\n\r\nThis could be fixed by either disabling Close Workspace on `Ctrl + W` or adding a configuration option that lets me control the behavior of `Ctrl + W` when no editors are open.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/54441","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/54441/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/54441/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/54441/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/54441","id":341752542,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNDE3NTI1NDI=","number":54441,"title":"Typing

there are numerous issues explaining that package _names_ cannot be autocompleted for scopes on the official registry or for private registries, that doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to autocomplete package _versions_.\r\n\r\nAnd I'd argue that atleast for private registries autocompleting the version is generally more important than autocompleting the name. The name is usually well known for internal dependencies. But the version range available; that not so much...\r\n\r\nAnyway, for scoped packages and even for scopes that are redirected to other registries using `registry` entries in `.npmrc`, the versions can be gotten from a simple `npm view` command, which returns a JSON structure that also holds all of a package's versions. No reason the functionality for that command couldn't be tapped for autocompletion as well.\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/54227","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/54227/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/54227/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/54227/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/54227","id":340869592,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNDA4Njk1OTI=","number":54227,"title":"Allow to associate a workspace folder to untitled documents","user":{"login":"ArtemGovorov","id":979966,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3OTk2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/979966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArtemGovorov","html_url":"https://github.com/ArtemGovorov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArtemGovorov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArtemGovorov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArtemGovorov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArtemGovorov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArtemGovorov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArtemGovorov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArtemGovorov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArtemGovorov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArtemGovorov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":343063018,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNDMwNjMwMTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/extensions","name":"extensions","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689392,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODkzOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"dcdcdc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2018-07-13T03:33:30Z","updated_at":"2018-07-17T21:12:10Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->\r\nCurrently VS Code workspace API doesn't allow to specify the workspace of the document being created with:\r\n```js\r\nopenTextDocument(options?: {content: string, language: string}): Thenable<TextDocument>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn our [Quokka extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.quokka-vscode) we allow users to select an active workspace (with `window.showWorkspaceFolderPick`).

the API for modifying settings supports to target the different settings stores (user, workspace, folder). This is powerful but a bit laborious to use.\r\n\r\nIf you need to update a value in the store where it came from, you need to write code to figure out where it came from and then select the appropriate target value for passing it to `WorkspaceConfiguration.update`.\r\n\r\nThis results in something like this:\r\n```\r\n\tconst conf = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('debug.node');\r\n\tconst info = conf.inspect('autoAttach');\r\n        const value = conf.get('autoAttach');\r\n\tlet target: vscode.ConfigurationTarget = vscode.ConfigurationTarget.Global;\r\n\tif (info) {\r\n\t\tif (info.workspaceFolderValue) {\r\n\t\t\ttarget = vscode.ConfigurationTarget.WorkspaceFolder;\r\n\t\t} else if (info.workspaceValue) {\r\n\t\t\ttarget = vscode.ConfigurationTarget.Workspace;\r\n\t\t} else if (info.globalValue) {\r\n\t\t\ttarget = vscode.ConfigurationTarget.Global;\r\n\t\t} else if (info.defaultValue) {\r\n\t\t\t// setting not yet used: store setting in workspace\r\n\t\t\tif (vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders) {\r\n\t\t\t\ttarget = vscode.ConfigurationTarget.Workspace;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\tconf.update('autoAttach', !value, target);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suggest that we simplify the API a bit.\r\n\r\nCurrently I see two approaches:\r\n\r\n1. Add a new enum value `originalTarget` to the `ConfigurationTarget` type. With this a setting value can be toggled like this: \r\n```\r\n    const conf = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('debug.node');\r\n    const value = conf.get('autoAttach');\r\n    conf.update('autoAttach', !value, vscode.ConfigurationTarget.originalTarget);\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Add a new attribute `effectiveTarget` to the structure returned from `WorkspaceConfiguration.inspect`. `effectiveTarget` would contain the target where the value came from. With this a setting value can be toggled like this: \r\n```\r\n    const conf = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('debug.node');\r\n    const info = conf.inspect('autoAttach');\r\n    const value = conf.get('autoAttach');\r\n    conf.update('autoAttach', !value, info.effectiveTarget);\r\n```\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/54147","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/54147/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/54147/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/54147/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/54147","id":340550157,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNDA1NTAxNTc=","number":54147,"title":"Provide an API to track a position in a document across edits","user":{"login":"DanTup","id":1078012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzgwMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1078012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanTup","html_url":"https://github.com/DanTup","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":290465400,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTA0NjU0MDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/api","name":"api","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":294817667,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTQ4MTc2Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/editor","name":"editor","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689392,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODkzOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"dcdcdc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDc4OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDc4OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2018-07-12T09:03:53Z","updated_at":"2019-10-08T09:25:06Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've come across a few places where this'd be handy lately. Most recently, I run some tests for my user and I get back positions in the document of where each test is - this allows them to click on the test in the runner/results to jump directly to it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, if the user modifies their test file then this location information becomes out of date and now jumps the user to the wrong location when they click it. This can be really common - you run your tests; 5 of them fail; you start working through them - working on the first test shifts the position of the tests below such that it's now difficult to jump to them from the test list.\r\n\r\nVS Code is presumably already tracking things like this for things like decorations so it'd be nice if we could use it too.

In this case, the completion items don't change when typing a dot, so the suggest widget should simple be kept open (but filtered accordingly).\r\n\r\nTo support of the first use case, we need to register `\".\"` as a trigger character, which means that `provideCompletionItems()` is invoked for the other case as well, even though it wouldn't be necessary there. But so far so good, we can simply return the same completion items again to keep the suggest widget open, and adjust the `range` of the items to match against the entire dot path typed so far.\r\n\r\nHere's a simple extension that simulates that:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n'use strict';\r\nimport * as vscode from 'vscode';\r\n\r\nexport function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {\r\n    vscode.languages.registerCompletionItemProvider('plaintext', {\r\n        provideCompletionItems(doc, pos, token, context) {\r\n            var range = new vscode.Range(new vscode.Position(0, 0), pos);\r\n            if (doc.getText(range) == \"Json.\") {\r\n                return [\r\n                    {label: \"parse\"},\r\n                    {label: \"stringify\"}\r\n                ];\r\n            }\r\n            return [\r\n                {label: \"haxe\", range: range},\r\n                {label: \"haxe.ds\", range: range},\r\n                {label: \"haxe.ds.Map\", range: range},\r\n                {label: \"haxe.ds.BalancedTree\", range: range},\r\n                {label: \"Json - haxe.Json\", insertText: \"Json\", range: range}\r\n            ];\r\n        }\r\n    }, \".\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis approach actually works quite well, but it causes an annoying interaction with the default behavior of  `\"editor.suggestSelection\"` (default is `recentlyUsed`). If the `Json - haxe.Json` entry has been selected before, it is auto-selected when typing the dot in `haxe.`:\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jZSTbky.gif)\r\n\r\nThis might not look like a big issue there, but with many completion items between the packages and `haxe.Json` it's more problematic. The packages you were just filtering against are now scrolled totally out of view: \r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tJS3NE0.gif)\r\n\r\nOf course, this can be worked around with `\"editor.suggestSelection\": \"first\"`, but that's not a great experience for our users. `preselect: true` also doesn't seem to help. Even if that's set for the `\"haxe.ds\"` item in the sample code above, the `Json` item is still auto-selected on `haxe.|`.\r\n\r\nI think the underlying issue here is that there isn't really a concept of \"keeping the completion open / leaving the results unchanged\", so VSCode thinks \"ah, there were results, so this is must be a _new_ completion and the `\"editor.suggestSelection\"` logic should be applied\". Could the intention of keeping completion open be detected implicitly somehow, perhaps by comparing the previous to the current `provideCompletionItems()` result? If so, the  `\"editor.suggestSelection\": \"recentlyUsed\"` step could be skipped in those cases.
