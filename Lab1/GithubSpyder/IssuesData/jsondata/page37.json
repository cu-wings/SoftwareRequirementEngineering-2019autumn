This is not safe and may leak disposables. Consider:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst disposables: IDisposable[] = [];\r\ndisposables.push(new DisposableThing());\r\ndispose(disposables);\r\ndisposables.push(new DisposableThing2());\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis results in `DisposableThing2` being leaked. This sequence of calls can easily happen in async code or in complex sync code\r\n\r\n### Proposed Fix\r\nReview places where we use `IDisposable[]`. In almost all cases, we should either:\r\n\r\n* For classes, extend `Disposable` instead of creating a `disposables` private property. The `Disposable` class correctly handles the above case.\r\n\r\n* In place of a `IDisposable[]`, use  `DisposableStore`  which was added by #74242 for this very reason.\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/74237","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/74237/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/74237/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/74237/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/74237","id":447903400,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NDc5MDM0MDA=","number":74237,"title":"Add

Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to have a configuration setting to display workspace folders as accordion tabs, rather than folders? I'm having an issue where it's difficult for me to tell exactly which workspace I'm currently in, and have trouble differentiating workspace folders and actual files at a glance. This is especially troublesome when there are a lot of files and subfolders in each workspace folder.\r\n\r\n![O08YKhwnnp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1059362/58283875-b0ed7900-7d66-11e9-8900-8a44d597ef97.gif)\r\n\r\nThis is a (non-functional) mockup of what I mean by \"accordion tabs\": \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1059362/58284636-42a9b600-7d68-11e9-9c78-d14f161a4d24.png)\r\n\r\nEach workspace folder has it's own section in the split view and can be expanded/collapsed individually, while still displaying at all times. Having this option would make traversing my workspace a lot easier :3 \r\n\r\nIf this option could be implemented, it would be fantastic!

use Ctrl + Shift + L frequently to select multiple matches and then replacing the selected items with something else. When writing a C++ code, this works very well. I recently started coding in Java and installed Java Extension Pack. vscode version 1.34.0, operating system Ubuntu 18.04.\r\n\r\nHere is how the problem occurs:\r\n\r\nSuppose you have a variable I that is used throughout the code. Consider the for loop\r\n\r\nfor(int i = 0 ; i < I ; i++ )\r\n\r\nMove the cursor next to I and press Ctrl + Shift + L to select all matches of I. Then start typing. A window comes up and you select one of the suggestions, say Global (a class). Once you press enter, some of the code is just disappeared. For example, the for loop is changed to\r\n\r\nfor(int i = 0 ; iGlobal ; i++ )\r\n\r\nwhich means that the < sign as well as the surrounding spaces are all repalced with the Global. As in C++, I expect that only the I variable is replaced with Global not the surrounding characters including the spaces. I attached a toy java project to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\n[Reproduce.zip](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/files/3209833/Reproduce.zip)\r\n\r\nThis issue also occurs in other cases than the attached example and also when you use Ctrl + D to add selection. It makes the add-selection approach highly unreliable and risky to use.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I think the source of issue is not in the add-selection, although add-selection is also affected by the issue. I just realized after pressing the enter button to select one of the suggestions for a variable A in [A], the right bracket of the array is removed.\r\n "},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/74169","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/74169/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/74169/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/74169/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/74169","id":447392806,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NDczOTI4MDY=","number":74169,"title":"EACCES error when watching directories containing inaccessible paths","user":{"login":"fabiospampinato","id":1812093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTIwOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1812093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiospampinato","html_url":"https://github.com/fabiospampinato","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiospampinato/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiospampinato/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiospampinato/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiospampinato/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiospampinato/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiospampinato/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiospampinato/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiospampinato/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiospampinato/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":622596331,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MjI1OTYzMzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/file-watcher","name":"file-watcher","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":286886536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyODY4ODY1MzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/upstream","name":"upstream","color":"dcdcdc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMDY5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMDY5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2019-05-23T00:03:35Z","updated_at":"2019-05-24T04:38:14Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->\r\n<!-- Also please test using the latest insiders build to make sure your issue has not already been fixed: https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/ -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Use Help > Report Issue to prefill these. -->\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.34.0\r\n- OS Version: macOS 10.14\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

1.33.1 (user setup)\r\nCommit: 51b0b28134d51361cf996d2f0a1c698247aeabd8\r\nDate: 2019-04-11T08:27:14.102Z\r\nElectron: 3.1.6\r\nChrome: 66.0.3359.181\r\nNode.js: 10.2.0\r\nV8: 6.6.346.32\r\nOS: Windows_NT x64 10.0.18362\r\n\r\nThe wrong text gets decorated if the user is typing when the decoration is applied.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Add the following to a didChangeTextDocument handler in an extension:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        let decoration: vscode.TextEditorDecorationType = vscode.window.createTextEditorDecorationType({\r\n            color: \"#FF00FF\"\r\n        });\r\n        let txt1: string = textDocumentChangeEvent.document.getText();\r\n        let editors: vscode.TextEditor[] = vscode.window.visibleTextEditors.filter(e => e.document.uri === textDocumentChangeEvent.document.uri);\r\n        for (let e of editors) {\r\n            e.setDecorations(decoration, [new vscode.Range(1, 1, 1,10)]);\r\n        }\r\n        let txt2: string = textDocumentChangeEvent.document.getText();\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Prepare a file with some text i.e.: \r\n\r\n```\r\nXXXXXXXXXXXX\r\nXXXXXXXXXXXX\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Put a breakpoint immediately after the first call to getText().\r\n4. When you hit that breakpoint, inspect txt1.  You will see the contents of the file.\r\n5. While remaining at the breakpoint, paste a couple lines to the start of the file.  For example, to make the file look like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nYYYYYYYYYYYY\r\nYYYYYYYYYYYY\r\nXXXXXXXXXXXX\r\nXXXXXXXXXXXX\r\n```\r\n\r\n6. Step past the second call to getText().  You will see it retains the original content.  This is good (better then changing the state of the document out from under us, before delivering didChangeTextDocument with the new edits).  The intention here is to set a decoration within the second line of X's, and the apparent state of the document seems to imply this is what to expect.\r\n7. Continue, allowing the didChangeTextDocument handler to return.\r\n\r\nSeeing: The decoration is applied to the wrong text.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"167\" alt=\"Capture\"

Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nWhen I rebase between branches vscode says I have ~5k files with changes. This can be resolved by refereshing - which changes to 0 files changed, but it will not resolve on it's own. I noticed it goes from 0 files changed (before checkout) and then during the checkout process goes to ~5k files changed, and then finishes checkout out the branch. Did the logic change on when the pane refreshes?\r\n\r\nThis started happening today after I updated, but I've been using vscode for a while now and i've never seen this before (so it's very new).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.34.0 (a622c65b2c713c890fcf4fbf07cf34049d5fe758, 2019-05-15T21:59:37.030Z)\r\nOS version: Windows_NT x64 10.0.17763\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>System

IntelliSense works out of the box differs between languages (feature are owners?) and I think that's confusing. The following concepts/styles exist\r\n\r\n* `accept on commit character` - A completion is inserted when a character is being pressed, e.g. `;` accept a completion *and* inserts that character. Extensions define what characters accept a completion and the setting `acceptSuggestionOnCommitCharacter` (default `true`) enables/disables this\r\n* `snippet mode on accept` - When a suggestion is accepted, snippet mode is entered. This can be simple, e.g only placing the cursor, or complex by defining multiple tab stops\r\n* `re-trigger on accept` - When a suggestion is accepted, suggest is invoked again. This doesn't exist as a concept in VS Code itself but extension achieve this via the accept-command API.
