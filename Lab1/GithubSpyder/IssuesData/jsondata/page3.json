Even worse, sometime you are not `sudoer` to do this. Sometime you work on another remote machine that have different path and you need to reconfigure the executable path. Simply because the bundled clang-format is not accessible by other extension. I can config them to the exact path, but there is a version number in the path so I need to update them again and again. Is it possible to make bundled executable accessible by others? That is, some extensions provide executables, other extensions reference it.

Run VS Code behind a proxy with HTTPS_PROXY set to an http url\r\n2. Use the Atlascode or any extension that makes https calls\r\n\r\nExpected: the requests work\r\nActual: the requests fail. Most of the time the error reported is \"socket hang up\"\r\n\r\nI believe the chromium proxy stuff internally handles tunneling https to http when running behind an http proxy, However, I don't think VS Code handles this when it rewrites the https module for extension proxy support.\r\n\r\nWe've been able to get around this by adding this to our axios requests when behind a proxy:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst [host, port] = getProxyHostAndPort();\r\n\r\n                let numPort = undefined;\r\n                if (host.trim() !== '') {\r\n                    if (port.trim() !== '') {\r\n                        numPort = parseInt(port);\r\n                    }\r\n                    agent = {\r\n                        httpsAgent: tunnel.httpsOverHttp({\r\n                            proxy: {\r\n                                host: host,\r\n                                port: numPort\r\n                            }\r\n                        }), proxy: false\r\n                    };\r\n                }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be ideal if VS Code just handled this for extensions.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/82367","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/82367/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/82367/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/82367/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/82367","id":505911673,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MDU5MTE2NzM=","number":82367,"title":"i

user selected other than default. Example: If i  configure Prettier formatter it will ask to configure, but once you set user cannot figure out how to reset it. Again user has to google what has to be done.\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.39.1 (88f15d17dca836346e787762685a40bb5cce75a8, 2019-10-10T23:31:28.683Z)\r\nOS version: Windows_NT x64

Opening more browser instances (e.g. File > New Window) will also collect them as Code instances. Happened the first time while clicking the \"If you'd like to read these release notes online, go to Updates on code.visualstudio.com.\" link on the \"Release Notes\" page but can also occur when opening the \"MDN Reference\" link while hovering over a CSS property.\r\n\r\n![Step2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45714854/66635586-d2fd7000-ec0f-11e9-8404-9f601ba539a0.png)\r\n\r\n![Step3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45714854/66635628-ea3c5d80-ec0f-11e9-9cfe-e07fb9248798.png)\r\n\r\nThe browser works normal it just gets sorted as VS Code instance. At first I even thought it is some kind of new build in browsing feature but stacking the new browser windows under the VS Code icon is not an intended behaviour, I guess :wink:

Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->\r\nI'm trying to create a more complex 'function' snippet, by allowing you to select different options for the signature after the snippet was selected.\r\n\r\nFor example, right now, I have a 'choice' for the visibility of the function, like\r\n`${1|public,private,protected|}`\r\n\r\nI want to be able to use the same functionality for the number of params and return type hints, including \"none\" as an option.\r\n\r\nRight now, it seems like multiline code will break the 'choice' syntax, and $variables don't work as options.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of what I'd like to be able to make work:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"Fancy function with options\": {\r\n\t\"scope\": \"php\",\r\n\t\"prefix\": [\"function\", \"func\"],\r\n\t\"body\": [\r\n\t\t\"/**\",\r\n\t\t\" *\",\r\n\t\t\" *\",\r\n\t\t\" * {|2@param $type $param,\",\r\n\t\t\" *

$param, $type1 $param1\\, $type2 $param2|}) {5|: $returntype, |} {\",\r\n\t\t\"    $0\",\r\n\t\t\"}\"\r\n\t],\r\n\t\"description\": \"Function\"\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis snippet would let me choose the visibility of the function\r\nthen how many params I show in the doc (1 or 2)\r\nthen how many params I show in the function (1 or 2)\r\nthen whether I return something in the doc\r\nthen whether there's a typehint on the function\r\nthen it would let me set the $returnType, $types, $params, and the $functionName\r\nbefore dropping me off at $0.\r\n\r\nI can achieve a similar result by implementing multiple snippets, but I would like something like what I described above.\r\n\r\nPS: If this is already possible somehow, I apologize in advance; I couldn't make it work."}]
