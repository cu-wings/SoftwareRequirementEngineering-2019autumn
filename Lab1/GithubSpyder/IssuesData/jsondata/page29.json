When focused on a fullscreen window, macOS will _not_ switch between \"spaces\" to access a different window (fullscreen or not) from the same app.  Each native fullscreen window is considered its own \"space.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, VSCode's \"quick switch window\" keybinding (`workbench.action.quickSwitchWindow`) does just that; it will switch between these native fullscreen windows.  But binding it to ⌘-` is disallowed by VSCode's \"keyboard shortcuts\"  GUI.  Hand-editing the JSON is possible--but it doesn't actually create the binding.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if there's a technical reason for this, or just a \"recommendation\" from Apple that apps don't allow binding to the shortcut.  I _do_ know that in JetBrains' IDEs, ⌘-` works akin to \"quick switch window\" with multiple native fullscreen windows, so there either a) isn't an OS-level embargo on using the shortcut, or b) JetBrains found some way to trick macOS into switching across spaces.\r\n\r\nIf a VSCode window is _not_ run in native fullscreen, and a user uses ⌘-` to switch windows, I would expect that VSCode would either a) override macOS' system-level shortcut, or b) delegate to it.  I don't know what's preferred, as long as VSCode exhibits the behavior expected by the user.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if this is an Electron-specific issue; if so, please close this.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77011","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77011/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77011/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77011/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/77011","id":465932829,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NjU5MzI4Mjk=","number":77011,"title":"[css]

the 'folders' field of a `.code-workspace` configuration file is an array of items, each of them defining a folder. Then, all of these are shown as level-1 items in the default File Explorer. I suggest to support nesting 'folder' items with arrays, which will be layout as level-1, level-2, level-3, etc. For example:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n{\r\n  \"folders\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"Project A\",\r\n      \"folders\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"path\": \"prjA/dirA\",\r\n          \"name\": \"Dir A\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"path\": \"prjA/dirB\",\r\n          \"name\": \"Dir B\"\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"Project B\",\r\n      \"folders\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"path\": \"prjB/frontend/src\",\r\n          \"name\": \"Frontend\"\r\n        }\r\n        {\r\n          \"name\": \"Backend\",\r\n          \"folders\": [\r\n            {\r\n              \"path\": \"prjB/api\",\r\n              \"name\": \"API\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n              \"path\": \"prjB/lib/src\",\r\n              \"name\": \"Library\"\r\n            }\r\n          ]\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"path\": \"common\",\r\n      \"name\": \"Common\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich would translate to the following File Explorer structure:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- Project A\r\n  - Dir A (prjA/dirA)\r\n  - Dir B (prjA/dirB)\r\n- Project B\r\n  - Frontend (prjB/frontend/src)\r\n  - Backend\r\n    - API (prjB/api)\r\n    - Library (prjB/lib/src)\r\n- Common (common)\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRelated to #74229, I believe that the most straighforward integration with this feature would be an option in the settings to display each level-1 item in a separate File Explorer View.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, a `group` field can be added to each item defined in the multi-root configuration file (be it a folder or an array). All the items with the same `group` identifier belong to a separate TreeView.\r\n\r\nRef #76902.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRelated to #76399, the `group` concept above would translate to an Editor Group. Hence, the shown tabs in a given Editor Group will depend on the 'location' ('group') of the currently active document.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRef #31308.\r\nRef #43188.\r\nRef #73312.\r\nRef

Start VSCode, open a large workspace, e.g. a clone of [mozilla-central](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/).\r\n2. Press cmd-P, and enter a file name, let it finish (this is to allow VSCode to seed the cache).\r\n3. Copy a filename from another app (e.g. terminal), then switch back to VSCode and press cmd-P, paste the file name using cmd-V.\r\n  * At this stage, VSCode completes almost immediately.\r\n4. Press enter to open it\r\n5. Now copy a relative path from the other app, switch back, cmd-P and cmd-V.\r\n  * Now wait about 5 - 10 (or more) seconds for the completion to appear.\r\n\r\nGiven this is a relative path, it should be able to find it just as quickly as searching for the filename.\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/76869","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/76869/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/76869/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/76869/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/76869","id":465193932,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NjUxOTM5MzI=","number":76869,"title":"Screen

Hey Coders! This patch addresses the issue first described in #32246, again in #48046 and #41199, and very possibly elsewhere.\r\n\r\nVSCode’s `cursorWordStartLeft` and `cursorWordEndRight` commands were implemented such that the caret moved between every word boundaries: navigating a string like `this.is.a.test` would require seven keystrokes (`this|.|is|.|a|.|test|`). Since most platforms jump over the far side of a boundary (`this|.is|.a|.test|`), it felt graceless and awkward.\r\n\r\nWorse: the commits which closed the original issues fixed left-to-right movement (<kbd>⌥</kbd>+<kbd>→</kbd>), but right-to-left navigation (<kbd>⌥</kbd>+<kbd>←</kbd>) was either untouched or broken again later. Q.v. the latest Insiders build:\r\n\r\n![insiders](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2207980/60680358-008c8d80-9e59-11e9-8c00-95a74e9fbbd8.gif)\r\n\r\nSince I’m new to the codebase, this is a potentially quite naïve solution—all I did was true up `WordOperations.moveWordLeft` to `WordOperations.moveWordRight`. If there’s a cleverer way I’m happy to take another shot at it.\r\n\r\nFor now, though, it seems to work. Here’s the very-OS-native Sublime:\r\n\r\n![st3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2207980/60680536-b8ba3600-9e59-11e9-94ad-b2ca17bc5661.gif)\r\n\r\n…and here’s this branch’s build:\r\n\r\n![patched](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2207980/60680563-c7085200-9e59-11e9-9f20-0a7f0bdf97f9.gif)\r\n\r\nThanks for taking a look, and please let me know if I can improve it."}]
