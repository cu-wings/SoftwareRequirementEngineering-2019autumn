is a UX improvement suggestion for \"Go to definition\" and when selecting an item from the outline. Note that JetBrains IDEs behave similar to this suggestion, so someone there thought about this issue, too.\r\n\r\nIf I asked you (i.e. a human) to scroll to a certain function or class, where would you position that function on the screen? You'd probably try to ensure that:\r\n\r\n* the whole class/function is visible (including signature, body)\r\n* comments preceding the function signature are also visible unless they're very long\r\n* maybe for functions longer than a few lines the whole body would be centered on the screen (though, I've often seen developers not care too much as long as the whole body is visible)\r\n\r\nA simplification of those rules is: Scroll the definition close to the top, but not exactly to the top, so the comments (and some extra context in case of variable definitions) are still visible.\r\n\r\nCurrently, \"Go to definition\" and other operations **center** the function **signature** within the window.\r\n\r\nIt would be more ergonomic to position the result closer to the top of the window because then you can see longer class/function definitions without scrolling and **most** of the code after the definition is usually more important than **most** of the code before the definition. We just have to ensure that sufficient context from before the definition is visible.\r\n\r\nSo, my suggestion is to have it revealed at around 20% of the screen height. I've tested that value and had some good experience with it. 15% might also be fine. IMHO, we shouldn't go beyond 25%."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/80719","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/80719/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/80719/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/80719/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/80719","id":492278440,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0OTIyNzg0NDA=","number":80719,"title":"Cannot

in VS Code we can load JSON schemas based on a setting that matches the file path...\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"json.schemas\": [\r\n    {\r\n        \"fileMatch\": [\r\n            \"openapi.json\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"url\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/master/schemas/v3.0/schema.json\"\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can also add a new property to the top of our JSON to load a schema for that specific file...\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"$schema\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/master/schemas/v3.0/schema.json\",\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat would be especially useful is if we could combine these functionalities so we could match an arbitrary property instead of `\"$schema\"` to load a schema file from the settings...\r\n\r\nMy use case is **OpenAPI** where the `\"$schema\"` property is not valid according to the OpenAPI JSON Schema. I'd like to resolve this as follows:\r\n\r\n*.vscode/settings.json*\r\n```json\r\n\"json.schemas\": [\r\n    {\r\n        \"fileMatch\": [\r\n            \"openapi.json\",\r\n            {\r\n

\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/master/schemas/v3.0/schema.json\"\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we have backward compatibility with the path string version, whilst also introducing an object version where we can specify a property to match, and even it's value...\r\n\r\n...for performance it may be necessary to mandate this is always the first property in the JSON object as I believe is the case with the current `\"$schema\" implementation."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/80709","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/80709/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/80709/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/80709/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/80709","id":492203495,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0OTIyMDM0OTU=","number":80709,"title":"Light

VSCode Version: 1.38\r\n- OS Version: Win 10 (1809) 17763.678\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open a large file 10GB (original opened using `--max-memory=12288mb`). Observe that VS Code works fine handling the large file\r\n2. Close VS code (note VS code options were previously set to hot close and restore on close)\r\n3. Opening any VS Code window, either normally or through the context menu will cause the old large file to be loaded on open\r\n4. At this point vs code will crash on opening within ~10 seconds. It will be functional within these 10 seconds but manual trying to close the window, file or editor will not have any effect. (Unfortunately I didn't take a screenshot of the error window but the dialog options were 'restart' which would reopen and perform perform steps 3. Onward again or just close the application)\r\n5. Attempting to change hot reload setting or restore previous state options during the functioning 10 seconds before crash take no effect on restart\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7859942/64691488-a88e8a80-d48a-11e9-969d-8bb3285e3a9f.png)\r\n\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: No\r\n\r\nThe solution is to start VS Code through the command line with the `--max-memory=12288mb` argument and to manually close the document to prevent attempting to hot reload. \r\n\r\nI'll attach the seetting.json. Note that I've commented the settings that I added as part of step 5, these weren't present originally.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"workbench.colorTheme\": \"Visual Studio Light\",\r\n
