I debugged it in the built version and here is what is happening:\r\n\r\n- in the test workspace this is happening the following LS provide diagnostics: tslint, TS and ESLint\r\n- on a keystroke all three LS update the diagnostics\r\n- this results to 3 calls to `_onMarkerChanges` here: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/editor/contrib/codeAction/codeActionModel.ts#L45\r\n- depending on the timeing these seem to get folded or not\r\n\r\nThe more general question for me is why the ESLint code action provider is called when TS or TSLint diagnostics change. I do already check if the diagnostics contain ESLint errors.

is a subclass of disposable because a few of its subclasses register listeners or other handlers that should be disposed of. However while investigating leakage of disposables, I noticed that we are not calling dispose on many actions that are created.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is causing any issues currently as only a subset of `Action` subclasses actually need to be disposable. \r\n\r\n**Repo**\r\n1. Enable the `TRACK_DISPOSABLES` flag here: \r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/2641bd536d53d34962b7a09496c1f421d9dfd0e3/src/vs/base/common/lifecycle.ts#L15\r\n \r\n    Note that this results in a lot of logging of false positives\r\n\r\n1.  Open OSS build and open a single editor\r\n1. Open dev tools and wait a moment for the `__is_disposable_tracked__` messages to stop being printing. Then clear the dev tools console\r\n1. Now split the editor and then close the split editor quickly to return to the original state\r\n\r\n**Bug**\r\nNote the warnings in the devtools console about various subclasses of `Action` not being disposed of properly. The printed call stack will start with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nat trackDisposable (lifecycle.ts:38)\r\n    at new Disposable (lifecycle.ts:132)\r\n    at new Action (actions.ts:68)\r\n

Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\n### Reproduce the Problem\r\n1. On a MacBook Pro, create a file with at least one line that is longer than the width of the editor window.\r\n2. Add a bunch of new lines until the file has a vertical scrollbar.\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\nIf a file in the editor is tall enough and wide enough to have both vertical and horizontal scrollbars, it is almost impossible to scroll vertically using the trackpad without also scrolling horizontally. This causes a jarring effect and makes it hard to visually track in the document while scrolling up or down.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nWhen using the trackpad to scroll vertically, there should be no simultaneous horizontal scrolling (or at least there should be more inertia before horizontal scrolling starts).\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code - Insiders 1.35.0-insider

is a duplicate of #46236. That issue has been auto-closed, apparently due to inactivity, but I have more information about the scenario and am willing to offer a pull request.\r\n\r\nI have an extension that contributes a treeview to the Test Explorer container. Each `TreeItem` represents a test, and different tests need different context menu items enabled based on properties of those tests. For example, some tests have expected output that can be compared with the actual output in a diff view, and some don't. Failed tests need an option to accept the new output as expected, but passed tests don't. The node for a test needs different options from the node for a test suite.\r\n\r\nToday, I can sort of make this work by giving each `TreeItem` a `contextValue` string with a space-separated list of tags, and using regular expressions in my `when` condition to look for the interesting tags or lack thereof.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd prefer is to specify an object as the value for `contextValue`, and be able to access individual properties of that object using `viewItem.propName`, similar to the existing support for `context.propName` that already exists.\r\n\r\nProposed changes:\r\n- Change the type of `TreeItem.contextValue` to `any` (or some suitably restricted type that allows an object type)\r\n- Within a `when` condition, `viewItem.propName` accesses the property named `propName` on `TreeItem.contextValue`, if `TreeItem.contextValue` is an object type.\r\n\r\nIf this sounds like a reasonable feature, I'm willing to contribute the PR to implement it.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/74696","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/74696/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/74696/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/74696/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/74696","id":450973546,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NTA5NzM1NDY=","number":74696,"title":"Render

It would be nice if a (perhaps enabled with an option) warning to prevent this.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/74637","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/74637/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/74637/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/74637/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/74637","id":450485710,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NTA0ODU3MTA=","number":74637,"title":"Improve directory appearance in search results","user":{"login":"akbyrd","id":484784,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDc4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/484784?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akbyrd","html_url":"https://github.com/akbyrd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akbyrd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akbyrd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akbyrd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akbyrd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akbyrd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akbyrd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akbyrd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akbyrd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akbyrd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":301186618,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDExODY2MTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/search","name":"search","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":578047123,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NzgwNDcxMjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/under-discussion","name":"under-discussion","color":"dcdcdc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzg3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzg3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2019-05-30T20:13:45Z","updated_at":"2019-08-02T03:59:34Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Issue Type: <b>Feature Request</b>\r\n\r\nThe directory path displayed in search results can be hard to visually parse.

of around a year ago node-pty is launched directly from the renderer process, while this does mean ctrl+c is responsive it has several downsides:\r\n\r\n- node-pty crashes will take down the entire window (https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/71966, https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/71789, https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/74181)\r\n- Data events from node-pty seems to be blocked by the event loop, I suspect this is main the reason conpty is slow, it may also be slowing down non-Windows data flow too\r\n- The remote case the connection can get overwhelmed by fast producing programs.\r\n\r\nMy proposal for these problems:\r\n\r\n- Reintroduce terminalProcess to host node-pty, calling it nodePtyHostProcess is probably a better name, this protects the extension host and renderer from crashes\r\n- Batch data events inside nodePtyHostProcess (https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/54093), reducing the amount of total events in favor of larger ones\r\n- Introduce a flow control mechanism which ensures the pty does not get too far ahead of xterm.js. This is a little more tricky for the remote case, one idea is to send an ack every x bytes from the renderer and nodePtyHostProcess will pause if it hasn't received the yth last ack (x and y need to be experimented with and may depend on latency) (related https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/2122, https://github.com/microsoft/node-pty/pull/304)"}]
