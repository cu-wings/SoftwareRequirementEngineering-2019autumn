a FS provider that wants to show the content of a zip file. It therefore registers a provider for a schema `zip`. It also allows to open a zip by using a folder uri `zip:///home/dbaeumer/myzip.zip`. \r\n\r\nWhen the FS provider receives the first call for an URI (which can look like `zip:///home/dbaeumer/myzip.zip/.vscode`) it needs to know which part of the URI is the root folder to open the zip. Searching for something like `name.zip` doesn't work since a folder could also be named `myDir.zip`. I see the following options:\r\n\r\n- we guaruntee that the first call is always a stat call with the root folder.\r\n- we guaruntee that the `workspace.workspaceFolders` is containing the root before the first call. We also guaruntee that:\r\n  - if a folder gets added a workspace folder add event is sent before the first call to the FS provider.\r\n  - if a folder gets removed it would be nice if no more calls to the FS provider are made. But an extensions could handle this gracefully knowing it has to.\r\n- we always pass in the root to the FS provider calls.\r\n- we add some `handle` & `unhandle` methods to the FS provider which are called if the provider should handle new roots or roots it handled disappear.\r\n- something else.\r\n\r\nI relied on the first one so far which actually was a false assumption. But to implement that correctly I need to know which assumptions I can make that hold.\r\n\r\nMy preference would either be the workspace folder array and event correctness or handle and unhandle on the FS

When it unfreezes, it hasn't really deleted the directory (although it shows as empty in the Explorer).\r\n\r\nAn easy way to generate such a directory is to build vcpkg (
