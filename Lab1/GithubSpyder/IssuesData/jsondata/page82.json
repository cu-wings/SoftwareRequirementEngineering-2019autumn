Type: <b>Feature Request</b>\r\n\r\nThe Visual Studio Code should identify which code snippet I'm trying to comment on, since anyone who does web development (html+php+js+css) sometimes has two (or more) language on the same line, but the type comment line of one does not work for the other.\r\nExample: if we have a type code:\r\n     `<p><?php echo $var; ?></ p>`\r\nthe VSC only comments thus, regardless of where the cursor is:\r\n     `<!--<p><?php echo $var; ?></p>-->`\r\nIdeal would be if he identified the code under the cursor and commented correctly:\r\n\r\nIf the cursor is in the html code snippet\r\n     `<p><?php echo $var; ?></p>` ==comment==>`<!--<p><?php echo $var; ?></p>-->`\r\n\r\nIf the cursor is in the php code snippet\r\n     `<p><?php echo $var; ?></p>` ==comment==> `<p><?php // echo $var; ?></p>`\r\n\r\nPs: The netbeans have managed to make that distinction, and this is very useful;\r\n\r\nThankful.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.25.1

Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->\r\nSearching didn't turn up any requests like this, or any means of accomplishing this.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->\r\nI am not talking about distinguishing between the \"main\" and additional cursors, such as in https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22621, but rather single cursors and multiple cursors.\r\n\r\nIt would be very useful to know at a glance whether edits you make will _only_ affect the cursor you're currently looking at, or whether there are other cursors (potentially out of the viewable area of the editor) that will have changes made too.  Since _a_ cursor is almost always in the center of your focal area when you're looking at your editor and typing, it would make sense for every cursor to indicate visually whether it is solo or one of many, rather than for the indicator to be (for example) in the status bar, where it will generally be unnoticed.\r\n\r\nI have on many occasions accidentally edited my code in multiple places because a previous change left multiple cursors hanging around.  In some cases I was interrupted from working and came to work without remembering about the multiple cursors.  In others it was the fact that VS Code has different rules about how long multiple cursors persist than the editor I used before it.  So (through years of using the other editor) I was accustomed to having the multiple cursors go away (for instance, after using an arrow key to move to another line) and through force of habit forgot that VS Code behaves differently in this regard.\r\n\r\nA strong visual indicator--such as the color of the cursor, though it could be something else--would solve this problem.  Ideally it would be configurable."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/55775","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/55775/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/55775/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/55775/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/55775","id":347493409,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNDc0OTM0MDk=","number":55775,"title":"vscode

would like to purpose an addition to the set of predefined variables that VS Code supports for `tasks.json` and `launch.json`.\r\n\r\nHere's my use case.\r\n\r\n- I have organized my code in modules, each module is just a folder with files.\r\n- Some file names end with suffixes such as `_test.cc` or `_windows.cc`\r\n- My build system relies on these conventions to generate build targets.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have to be able to specify the surrounding context, i.e. module name without full path information, and I cannot do that, therefore this suggested change.\r\n\r\nMy current workaround looks like this, note the extra hackery for getting debugger launch to work (since I cannot launch the debugger through a batch script).\r\n\r\nlaunch.json:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"Debug (test)\",\r\n  \"type\": \"cppvsdbg\",\r\n  \"request\": \"launch\",\r\n  \"program\":\r\n    \"${workspaceFolder}/t2-output/win64-msvc-debug-default/temp_${fileBasenameNoExtension}.exe\",\r\n  \"args\": [],\r\n  \"stopAtEntry\": false,\r\n  \"cwd\": \"${workspaceFolder}\",\r\n  \"environment\": [],\r\n  \"externalConsole\": false,\r\n  \"preLaunchTask\": \"Build (test)\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\ntasks.json:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"label\": \"Build (test)\",\r\n  \"type\": \"shell\",\r\n  \"command\": \"build-test ${fileDirname} ${fileBasenameNoExtension}\",\r\n  \"group\": \"build\",\r\n  \"problemMatcher\": [\r\n    \"$msCompile\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nbuild-test.cmd:\r\n\r\n```batch\r\nset DIR_BASENAME=\r\n\r\nfor %%i in (%1) do (\r\n  set DIR_BASENAME=%%~nxi\r\n)\r\n\r\ntundra2 \"%DIR_BASENAME%_%2\"\r\n\r\ncd t2-output\\win64-msvc-debug-default\r\ndel /q \"temp_%2.exe\" 2>NUL\r\ncopy \"%DIR_BASENAME%_%2.exe\" \"temp_%2.exe\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe end result is that I can just hit F5 and go based on a single file that I'm working on but it would be nice if I could forgo all the intermediate steps and I think it could be useful for other people as well to be able to refer the surrounding directory name as a basename. My setup was inspired by conventions laid out in the Go project and since package names in Go work in a similar way to my module system I think it could be of use to people doing work in Go as well.\r\n\r\nI know this is an incomplete pull request, in that it lacks tests and localized documentation for this new variable but I wanted to know if this was something we could add?"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/55606","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/55606/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/55606/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/55606/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/55606","id":346764275,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNDY3NjQyNzU=","number":55606,"title":"When

showing up ~~intermittently, and though I can't predict when it will happen~~, it is guaranteed to happen after VS Code has been open for a while.\r\n\r\nI have a multiroot workspace in which I'm working on a JavaScript project. I often use the \"rename\" feature, sometimes on a local symbol, and sometimes on an imported or exported symbol. The error has shown up in both cases. Note that the error _only_ happens when I try to rename something, and I can usually rename things for a while before the error first appears. Once it has appeared, it occurs every time until I restart VS Code. When the error shows up, the rename fails to execute, which means I can't ignore the error and rename anyway.\r\n\r\nThe error is \"Overlapping ranges are not allowed!\". The error has only been occurring in the last month or so, and I have systematically gone through, disabling extensions I've installed in that time, and extensions that interact with the editor.\r\n\r\n~~I've run with extensions disabled, but because the error can take some time to show up, it's hard to draw conclusions from that. I've also been running in verbose mode in order to try and capture some data to report here.~~\r\n\r\n~~At the very least, it'd be good to get some advice on how I can figure out which extensions were trying to get involved with whatever led to the error being thrown, because the stack trace doesn't highlight anything obvious to me, the output windows don't show any extension-specific errors or logs that seem relevant, and the process window doesn't show any nonstandard background extensions running either.~~\r\n\r\n**Update:** I have ALL extensions currently disabled and I have found a point in my code where this error reliably occurs first time, every time. Unfortunately I can't seem to reproduce it with a simpler project setup. I have updated my various dependencies so that TypeScript 3.0.1 is everywhere, and have tried setting the current TypeScript version in VS Code to both 2.9.2 (VS Code's version) and 3.0.1 (workspace version). The error happens in both cases.\r\n\r\n[renderer1.log seems relevant](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/files/2251151/renderer1.log) (shows error trace within)\r\n\r\n[Here is the console trace log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/files/2251089/trace.log)\r\n\r\n[Here is a zip of the tsserver log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/files/2251122/tsserver.zip) (Doesn't show any errors,

Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n```shell\r\n$ git init\r\n$ touch 1\r\n$ git add .\r\n$ git commit -m\"foo\"\r\n$ echo foo > 1\r\n$ git difftool\r\n```\r\nThe _git difftool_ command is defined as:\r\n```shell\r\ncode-insiders --wait --diff \\\"$LOCAL\\\" \\\"$REMOTE\\\"\r\n```\r\nWhen invoking `git difftool`, VS Code will correctly show one change for the repository, but will also show more than 5k changes in `$TEMP`, but there is no git repository at that location.\r\n![screenshot1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24615132/43445387-848445d2-94a6-11e8-8186-71ff700aedd9.png)\r\nWhy would VS Code load any source control provider here?\r\n\r\nThere is also a message popping up:\r\n![screenshot2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24615132/43445499-d3e582b2-94a6-11e8-912a-14e38bc6bd90.png)\r\n\r\nIf I invoke the same command line manually, i. e. `code-insiders --wait --diff $TEMP/S9bziC_1 1`, the source control view behaves correctly, showing only one diff:\r\n![screenshot3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24615132/43445737-6807282e-94a7-11e8-942f-b4211080b1cb.PNG)\r\nI noticed that in that case, VS code does not show a source control provider, but says 'SOURCE CONTROL: GIT'.\r\n\r\nWhy does it make a difference whether `code-insiders --diff` is spawned from the git process vs. invoked by command line directly?\r\n\r\nVS Code
