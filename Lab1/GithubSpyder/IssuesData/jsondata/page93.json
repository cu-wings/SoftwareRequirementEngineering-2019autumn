Feature Request for multiple keybindings.json files\r\n\r\n## How it works now\r\nManually copy/paste desired config into `keybindings.json`, repeat to switch back\r\n\r\n## Feature request\r\nAllow multiple keybinding config files to be imported and selected programmatically\r\n\r\n# Why\r\nAs a programmable keyboard user, I have one workflow for when I'm using my external keyboard, and another for when I'm using my laptop.  I would like to be able to define a set of keybindings for each use case separately, and be able to toggle between both from within VSCode.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\nOn my keyboard, I use `FN+ j/k/i/l` as arrow keys, which outputs the native keycodes for `left/down/up/right`.  To duplicate this behavior on my laptop keyboard, I have to define the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"key\": \"ctrl+j\",\r\n    \"command\": \"cursorLeft\",\r\n    \"when\": \"textInputFocus\"\r\n},\r\n{\r\n    \"key\": \"ctrl+k\",\r\n    \"command\": \"cursorDown\",\r\n    \"when\": \"textInputFocus\"\r\n},\r\n{\r\n    \"key\": \"ctrl+i\",\r\n    \"command\": \"cursorUp\",\r\n    \"when\": \"textInputFocus\"\r\n},\r\n{\r\n    \"key\": \"ctrl+l\",\r\n    \"command\": \"cursorDown\",\r\n    \"when\": \"textInputFocus\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, when I switch back, I've got to reset these bindings to the defaults (along with all of the other keyboard-specific shortcuts I've defined).  This would be far easier if I could just select from a pre-existing keybinding config from within the editor."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/49279","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/49279/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/49279/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/49279/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/49279","id":320535913,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMjA1MzU5MTM=","number":49279,"title":"Do not delete tab-ful of spaces when pressing backspace","user":{"login":"yushiyangk","id":9082950,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwODI5NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/9082950?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yushiyangk","html_url":"https://github.com/yushiyangk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yushiyangk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yushiyangk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yushiyangk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yushiyangk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yushiyangk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yushiyangk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yushiyangk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yushiyangk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yushiyangk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129993,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTYxMjk5OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"8D6673","default":true},{"id":577463440,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1Nzc0NjM0NDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-autoindent","name":"editor-autoindent","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":425577013,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MjU1NzcwMTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-core","name":"editor-core","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjkyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjkyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2018-05-05T19:37:36Z","updated_at":"2019-01-18T16:13:12Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Suppose that tab width is set to 4, and a line begins with 8 spaces followed by some text.

the vscode extension [Better Jinja](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/jinjahtml-vscode) the `jinja-html` language highlights jinja html templates, however some more advanced features available with the `html` langauge are not working with `jinja-html`:\r\n* highlighting the opening tag when the cursor is in the closing tag (and visa versa) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4039449/39631948-95a001c0-4fab-11e8-911d-6fd571357b76.png)

the sibling of the tag under the cursor\r\n* auto creating the closing tag once the opening tag is created.\r\n\r\nAnd probably more, but these are the two which would be most useful.\r\n\r\nHow do I get these advanced features working in my child language definition?\r\n\r\nI've tried copying most of the config from `extensions/html/package.json` and `extensions/html/language-configuration.json` into my extension but to no avail. I also tried looking through `extensions/html-language-features` but there's nothing obvious there to include.\r\n\r\nThis isn't as simple as adding more file extensions somewhere, even in a `.html` file if the language is changed to `jinja-html` the features above disappear.\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: `1.22.2 3aeede733d9a3098f7b4bdc1f66b63b0f48c1ef9 x64`\r\n- OS Version: ubuntu 18.04\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. install \"Better Jinja\"\r\n2. open or create a file with some html in\r\n3. change the language to `jinja-html`\r\n4. try using advanced html features as described above\r\n\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes (the advanced features work with the `html` language without extensions, obviously the error can only be shown with the

indentation.\r\n\r\nUnexpected:\r\nFollow steps 1-3 again.\r\n4. place the cursor at the beginning of the newline and press delete.\r\n5. vscode will remove a single whitespace.\r\n\r\nExpected: pressing delete should forward delete a whole tab indentation rather than a single space."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/49152","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/49152/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/49152/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/49152/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/49152","id":320112569,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMjAxMTI1Njk=","number":49152,"title":"Right

simultaneously, much in the same way hovers can be provided from multiple extensions and are displayed in the same hover popup.\r\n\r\nThe background for this is:\r\nI have a language server based extension for VS Code that can deliver documentHighlight information for Java code, but as long as the Java language extension itself is installed and active, my documentHighlights are never shown (but the ones from the Java extension instead).\r\n\r\nThe purpose of my language server is to provide additional functionality for Java source code, not to replace the existing Java language tooling. Therefore I benefit from the ability to run multiple language servers for the same language (file type) and that the results from both are merged (which is the case for content assist and hover information, for example).

Select any two files in Explorer view\r\n2. Right click -> Compare Selected\r\n\r\nThe resulting comparison pane has a number of issues carried over from when it was exclusively for comparing versions in a source-control context.\r\n\r\n* You can't edit the left-most (first selected) file.  In this context, that makes no sense, since they're both just files on disk.\r\n* Select a range -> Stage Selected Ranges, results in a Git error dialog (\"cannot add to the index\").\r\n* The Unstage command does nothing (no error message)\r\n* Revert Selected Ranges totally hoses the file, I'm not totally clear on what it's removing or why but it's pretty bad.\r\n \r\nThe command menu should instead include \"Copy to right/left\" actions as in #25887.  Broadly, the comparison view should *optionally* treat the left side as read-only (which makes sense in `git diff` context) and at least stop using \"stage\" actions when not opened by a source-control provider.  IMHO, \"left/right\" terminology is always clear while \"stage/unstage\" is only helpful in very limited context.\r\n"}]
