Overview\r\n\r\nLanguages like Razor (and I imagine HTML for custom attributes) typically have scenarios where portions of the document are semantically a different language.\r\n\r\nIn Razor this happens frequently through the use of TagHelpers or in Blazor:\r\n```Razor\r\n<form asp-antiforgery=\"ViewBag.ShouldRenderAntiforgery\">\r\n...\r\n</form>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example we'd expect that `ViewBag.ShouldRenderAntiforgery` would be C#. The way TagHelpers (things that apply to HTML and change the semantic language of the right hand side of an attribute) can be customized by users is limitless so we need to have full control over telling the IDE what things are C# and what things aren't.\r\n\r\n## Ideas on how to implement\r\n\r\nOver in the [issue ](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/77133) where the discussion of general semantic colorization the proposal was to have an API similar to:\r\n\r\n```TypeScript\r\ninterface SemanticHighlightRangeProvider {\r\n   provideHighlightRanges(doc,...): [ Range, TokenType, TokenModifier[] ][];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe proposed approach can also be used to enable semantic language colorization without enabling an entire language's extensions for a subset of a document.\r\n\r\nTo do this one could expand on the `ThemeDefinition` and add a `language` parameter:\r\n```TypeScript\r\ninterface TokenStyle {\r\n   foreground?: Color | ColorFunction\r\n   style?: bold | italic | underline\r\n   language?: string\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis would enable LanguageServers to mark a chunk of text in an editor as a Token that associates with a specific language. This would work similarly to how tooltips/completion descriptions etc. work when specifying pieces of text that should be colorized as a certain language.\r\n\r\nSo in the first example `asp-antiforgery=\"ViewBag.ShouldRenderAntiforgery\"` Razor's language server would indicate that the entire `ViewBag.ShouldRenderAntiforgery` was of a Razor specific theme that had a token Style of:\r\n```JSON\r\n{\r\n    \"language\": \"csharp\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis would enable future scenarios where if Razor wanted to go above and beyond to provide semantic colorization of specific tokens it could do it in an additive fashion on top of existing theme."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81555","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81555/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81555/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81555/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/81555","id":499517578,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzIyMjIyMjYw","number":81555,"title":"Search

Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nThe search indexer (ripgrep?) seems to index the entire project before performing a search even if the \"files to include\" option excludes 99% of the file tree. After indexing is complete, search results are nearly instant, but the index seems to be invalidated at least a couple times a day (I'm not sure what the mechanism is).\r\n\r\nOur codebase at work contains at least 10k files, and performing a global search on it literally slows my mouse down if the index has to be rebuilt.\r\n\r\nWould it be feasible/faster to glob the \"files to include\" option first, build a list of files to search, then search only those files?\r\n\r\nIf not, is there something I can do to prevent the index from being invalidated so often?\r\n\r\nVS Code version:

dir and does not go recursively and it would be invoked to scan once we open a dir in file explorer.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that we usually have tons of file in a project and also soft-link to other projects that can potentially create loops. And I notice that file scanning really cause vscode to consume too much CPU and mem at the starting. \r\nHence, while I do NOT want to exclude those folders as I occasionally need to dig into them to see if things are alright, I really want to have an option to keep vscode from crazily scanning my file systems and from freezing the system every time vscode is started.

This is especially a problem when launching a extension debug session. In this case the extension is never fully initialized and an error appears after 10 seconds. Additionally, after closing the debug instance of vscode the debug session is not closed and I have to manually stop it.\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.38.1 (b37e54c98e1a74ba89e03073e5a3761284e3ffb0,

`DebugConfigurationProvider` may resolve a configuration that includes a `preLaunchTask`.  This task will be executed after resolution (obviously) but executed before the debugging session starts.\r\n\r\nThere are several scenarios (e.g. in the case of Docker debugging) where details of the debugging session (e.g. the port to which the debugger should attach) may ultimately depend on that pre-launch task (e.g. mapping a given container port to a host port).  However, because the debug configuration is resolved *before* the task executes, it requires upfront agreement between the task configuration and the debug configuration and precludes the debug configuration being derived from the *result* of the pre-launch task.  E.g. the user must explicitly choose a port for both to use rather than the pre-launch task determine an available port and have debug configuration use that available port.\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful if a `DebugConfigurationProvider` had a means of deferring resolution of certain properties of its configuration until *after* the pre-launch task (if any) has executed.  The `DebugConfigurationProvider` could then use the results of that execution to alter its previously resolved configuration (if necessary).\r\n\r\nAn, initial, likely naive API might look like:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\ninterface DebugConfigurationProvider {\r\n    // Existing API:\r\n    provideDebugConfigurations(folder: WorkspaceFolder | undefined, token?: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<DebugConfiguration[]>;\r\n    resolveDebugConfiguration(folder: WorkspaceFolder | undefined, debugConfiguration: DebugConfiguration, token?: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<DebugConfiguration | undefined>;\r\n\r\n    // Proposed API:\r\n    // Called after the preLaunchTask successfully executes but before debugging starts and includes the executed pre-launch task object (presumably used to derive any necessary changes).\r\n    resolveDebugConfigurationPostLaunchTask?(folder: WorkspaceFolder | undefined, debugConfiguration: DebugConfiguration, preLaunchTask: Task, token?: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<DebugConfiguration | undefined>\r\n}\r\n```"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81433","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81433/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81433/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81433/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/81433","id":498390999,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0OTgzOTA5OTk=","number":81433,"title":"Updating
