branch](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/extensions/typescript-language-features/src/typeScriptServiceClientHost.ts#L120)\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIts quite complicated\r\n\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?:\r\nYes, but the issue is with an [extension](https://github.com/Ventilador/vue-lang-extension) im building.\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently the typescript language feature extension uses the [LanguageProvider](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/extensions/typescript-language-features/src/languageProvider.ts#L24) to register capabilities for a ts-based language from a tsserver plugin. The thing is, when creating the descriptor for the languageProvider, the [TypeScriptServiceClientHost](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/extensions/typescript-language-features/src/typeScriptServiceClientHost.ts#L120) hardcodes the \"_typescript-plugins_\" id to the descriptor, later, when the language provider gets registered, there are some language capabilities, like [completions](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/extensions/typescript-language-features/src/features/completions.ts#L707), [formatting](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/extensions/typescript-language-features/src/features/formatting.ts#L95), [implementationsCodeLens](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/extensions/typescript-language-features/src/features/implementationsCodeLens.ts#L100), [jsDocCompletions](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/extensions/typescript-language-features/src/features/jsDocCompletions.ts#L118), [referencesCodeLens](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/extensions/typescript-language-features/src/features/referencesCodeLens.ts#L102), [dependentRegistration](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/extensions/typescript-language-features/src/utils/dependentRegistration.ts#L89) and [tagClosing](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/extensions/typescript-language-features/src/features/tagClosing.ts#L172), that use the [ConfigurationDependentRegistration](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/extensions/typescript-language-features/src/utils/dependentRegistration.ts#L89), which as the name says, it registers the capability only if a certain config value is set to truthy. That config is based on the descriptors id, which is used as a main section to search the config file, it ends up doing\r\n\r\n`vscode.workspace.getConfiguration(descriptor.id, null).get('suggest.enabled')`\r\n\r\nwhere `descriptor.id` is \"_typescript-plugins_\".\r\nIm currently working around it, and configured my contributions as follows\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"configuration\": {\r\n    \"title\": \"Vue-lang\",\r\n    \"properties\": {\r\n      \"typescript-plugins.suggest.enabled\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"boolean\",\r\n        \"default\": true,\r\n        \"description\": \"Enable the usage of intellisense.\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"typescript-plugins.format.enable\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"boolean\",\r\n        \"default\": true,\r\n        \"description\": \"Enable/disable the vue document formatter.\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"typescript-plugins.implementationsCodeLens.enabled\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"boolean\",\r\n        \"default\": true,\r\n        \"description\": \"Enable/disable the vue document implementations CodeLens helper\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"typescript-plugins.suggest.completeJSDocs\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"boolean\",\r\n        \"default\": true,\r\n        \"description\": \"Enable/disable the vue document suggestions for jsDocs.\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"typescript-plugins.referencesCodeLens.enabled\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"boolean\",\r\n        \"default\": true,\r\n        \"description\": \"Enable/disable the vue document references CodeLens helper.\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"typescript-plugins.autoClosingTags\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"boolean\",\r\n        \"default\": true,\r\n        \"description\": \"Enable/disable the vue document auto closing tags.\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nnotice my **config section**, has to be **typescript-plugins**.\r\nPerhaps that value could be included in the `contributes.typescriptServerPlugins` \r\n```\r\ncontributes.typescriptServerPlugins.configNamespace: \"string\"\r\n// or\r\ncontributes.typescriptServerPlugins.capabilities: [\"arrayOfString\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n_kinda offtopic:_\r\nare there any other language provided feature that are enabled like those listed in my issue?

says to file issues in this repo]\r\n\r\nIf you run a node process with `node --inspect-port=1234 sleep-forever.js`, the VSCode `${command:PickProcess}` command picker suggests to connect to the process using port 1234.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60228/59865012-e0c77680-933c-11e9-956f-5047acf28821.png)\r\n\r\nHowever, because `--inspect` wasn't specified, the port isn't opened until a `kill -USR1 <pid>` is issued, so the picker doesn't work. A workaround is to kill the process.\r\n\r\nI suspect the issue is at https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-node-debug/blob/56dc3892885b3122385b785322b00a92d33fdded/src/node/extension/protocolDetection.ts#L233 where the regexp looking for `--inspect` is finding `--inspect-port` and assuming debugging is already \"open.\"\r\n\r\nIn my environment, I'm trying to setup distinct, different ports for my different node processes so that multiple can be debugged simultaneously, so I'm using `--inspect-port` to facilitate that, but I don't wish to have the debugging enabled by default. (I'm starting the processes outside of VSCode at the moment.)\r\n\r\nNote that if the node process updates `process.title` this picker fails in other interesting ways, but that's much more of an edge case.\r\n\r\nThis issue is similar to https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/46664 but I think a slightly different workflow.\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.35.1 \r\n- OS Version: Mac OS 10.14.5 \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n0. Install vscode-node-debug\r\n1. Start a node process with `--inspect-port`\r\n2. Create a debug configuration following \"Attach to Process\"\r\n3. Try to attach; observe that it tries to connect using the port rather than SIGUSR1.\r\n\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: n/a\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75844","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75844/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75844/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75844/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/75844","id":458694809,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NTg2OTQ4MDk=","number":75844,"title":"Setting to render active line number","user":{"login":"svipas","id":10441177,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQxMTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10441177?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/svipas","html_url":"https://github.com/svipas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svipas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svipas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svipas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svipas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svipas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svipas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svipas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svipas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svipas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODkzOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"dcdcdc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjkyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjkyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2019-06-20T14:32:56Z","updated_at":"2019-06-25T22:37:27Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Currently, we have `editor.renderLineHighlight` which is useful if you want to show or hide the current line highlight.

VSCode Snap is created with Snap's [classic confinement](https://docs.snapcraft.io/snap-confinement), which means that Snapcraft doesn't handle application or user state, making the [snapshot feature](https://docs.snapcraft.io/snapshots) useless.\r\n\r\nWhen creating a Snap with _strict confinement (default)_, Snapcraft sandboxes the application and runs in an isolated secure environment, and overrides various environment variables. With classic confinement, [this is not the case](https://github.com/snapcore/snapd/wiki/Environment-Variables#home).\r\n\r\n> **Classic**\r\n> Allows access to your system’s resources in much the same way traditional packages do. To safeguard against abuse, publishing a classic snap requires manual approval, and installation requires the --classic command line argument.\r\n\r\nAll application/user data created with Snap applications using _strict confinement_ can be manipulated with the Snapcraft snapshot feature. Why isn't Code under strict confinement?\r\n\r\nSee examples for Code _(classic)_ and ngrok _(strict)_ below.\r\n\r\nVSCode (`code`) has the following CLI arguments: `--user-data-dir` and `--extensions-dir` so this can be set/overridden, but the user of the Snap cannot set these. Unless doing something like this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ snap run --shell code\r\n$ code\r\n$ code --user-data-dir=$SNAP_USER_DATA\r\n```\r\n\r\nI saw this issue which could possibly relate to this in some way: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3884\r\n\r\n<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->\r\n<!-- Also please test using the latest insiders build to make sure your issue has not already been fixed: https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/ -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Use Help > Report Issue to prefill these. -->\r\n- VSCode Version: `1.35.1 c7d83e57cd18f18026a8162d042843bda1bcf21f x64`\r\n- OS Version: `Linux Mint 19.1 (Ubuntu); 4.15.0-51-generic`\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Install code snap (`snap install code --classic`)\r\n2. Change user settings (`~/.config/Code/User/settings.json`)\r\n3. Save state of snap (`snap save code`)\r\n4. Change user settings again (`~/.config/Code/User/settings.json`)\r\n5. Restore previous user settings (`snap restore 1`)\r\n\r\nPrevious version of `settings.json` is not restored.\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nDoes this issue occur

Background\r\nIn #39048, @joaomoreno says about the command `git.restoreCommitTemplate`:\r\n\r\n> I don't think it's a command worth putting in the command palette. Seems to be very specific for users who actively modify .gitmessage, doesn't happen often.\r\n\r\nThis might be true, but there are definitely more actions (than just `commit`) where it would make sense to read the git commit template, because if you know what you can do with this, this is so damn useful. :)\r\n\r\n## Problem:\r\nPersonally, I use the git commit template to follow our team's git commit message and branch naming conventions, which says that the commit message and the branch you are working on have to be prefixed with the id of the corresponding Jira issue.\r\n\r\nSo I created a git hook for writing the recently used commit message into the commit template on `post-commit` and also a hook on `post-checkout` to write the current branch name (title-cased) into the commit template when I create a new branch.\r\n:heavy_check_mark: When I commit something, the git commit template updates and the last commit message stays in the scm message box.\r\n:negative_squared_cross_mark: But in order to get the updated content from that template after a `git checkout`, I have to invoke `git.restoreCommitTemplate`.\r\n\r\nTemporarily [I could fix this](https://gist.github.com/dmstern/d02ea41d4b0171ff2f4661daaa3e3f86) with a macro extension and mapped the `workbench.view.scm` keyboard shortcut to my new macro, which does both (`git.restoreCommitTemplate` and `workbench.view.scm`). But (a) this works only with this shortcut, not if I click on the scm icon in the activity bar and (b) I think this behavior should be possible without an extension.\r\n\r\n## Possible solution:\r\nPlease invoke `git.restoreCommitTemplate` every time `workbench.view.scm` is invoked or on every [`git.refresh`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/4e7545ba8a536237387848e2b8220d2b562ae041/extensions/git/src/commands.ts#L237)\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75646","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75646/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75646/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75646/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/75646","id":457086163,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NTcwODYxNjM=","number":75646,"title":"Horizontal scroll keeps getting disabled","user":{"login":"raghulaihos","id":24653998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjUzOTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/24653998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raghulaihos","html_url":"https://github.com/raghulaihos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raghulaihos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raghulaihos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raghulaihos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raghulaihos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raghulaihos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raghulaihos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raghulaihos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raghulaihos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raghulaihos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":556079247,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NTYwNzkyNDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/electron","name":"electron","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":272689423,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODk0MjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"E2A1C2","default":false},{"id":286886536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyODY4ODY1MzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/upstream","name":"upstream","color":"dcdcdc","default":false},{"id":374931321,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNzQ5MzEzMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"006b75","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMDY5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMDY5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2019-06-17T18:28:08Z","updated_at":"2019-10-09T08:20:48Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\n1) Open VS code\r\n2) Scroll sideways with touchpad (works initially but gets disabled after a while)\r\n3) If the VS code window is restored down, the horizontal scroll gets enabled.

This means if pressing a key triggers a command that blocks in another extension (for example the first character press can trigger code completion, which if the list is 20,000 items can block the thread for a little while while they're build + serialised) the typing in the editor is really sluggish.\r\n\r\nYou can easily reproduce this by making an extension that blocks for 1s when asked for completions:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ncontext.subscriptions.push(vscode.languages.registerCompletionItemProvider({ scheme: \"file\" }, {\r\n\tprovideCompletionItems(document: vscode.TextDocument, position: vscode.Position, token: vscode.CancellationToken, context: vscode.CompletionContext): vscode.ProviderResult<vscode.CompletionItem[] | vscode.CompletionList> {\r\n\t\tconsole.log('Completion request');\r\n\t\tvar start = Date.now();\r\n\t\tlet i = 0;\r\n\t\twhile (Date.now() < start + 10000) {\r\n\t\t\t// Block for a second...\r\n\t\t\ti++;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\treturn [new vscode.CompletionItem(`aaaItem (${i} iterations)`)];\r\n\t},\r\n}));\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you run this and enabled the Vim plugin, when you start typing on a newline (which triggers completion), the characters you type won't appear for a while.\r\n\r\nOf course, extensions should try to avoid blocking the extension host as much as possible, but sometimes it's unavoidable (for ex. assembling and serialising a huge number of completion items). It's not clear where users should raise bugs, since in isolation neither extension is really doing anything wrong.\r\n\r\nI don't know what the fix is (separate extension host for type-handling extensions might work, but that might also be a huge task), but I couldn't find any issues discussing this and figured it was worth some discussion (even if only to have the information described in one place we can point people to that hit these issue)."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75617","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75617/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75617/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75617/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/75617","id":456789402,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NTY3ODk0MDI=","number":75617,"title":"[json]

in order to prompt for a process to attach to - does so *before* running any pre-launch tasks (`preLaunchTask` property).\r\n\r\n* Is this by design?\r\n* Is there a way to reverse this order?\r\n\r\nThe reason I want my prelaunch task to run _first_ is twofold:\r\n\r\n* generally, since my prelaunch task includes building, I want the launch to be aborted if building fails.\r\n\r\n* specifically, my prelaunch task _creates_  the process that I then want to attach to.\r\n\r\nTaking a step back, my ideal solution would be to have the prelaunch task not only _create_ the process to attach to, but to have the launch configuration _automatically attach_ to it afterwards, but I haven't found a way to do that, given that:\r\n\r\n*  starting the debugger from the command line isn't supported yet - though support is being considered - see #10979\r\n\r\n* there seems to be no way to populate a launch-configuration property from an arbitrary shell command (you can only call VSCode-internal commands via `${command:...}`).\r\n\r\nNote: I hit this limitation when trying to debug binary PowerShell modules via an external PowerShell console. I've since realized that the C# debugger _automatically_ attaches to any external process created via a `\"request\": \"launch\"` launch configuration, so launching a PowerShell console that way (with a startup command that imports the binary module) is sufficient.\r\n \r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75603","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75603/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75603/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/75603/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/75603","id":456675625,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NTY2NzU2MjU=","number":75603,"title":"Better documentation for individual settings","user":{"login":"jabacchetta","id":12591890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTkxODkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/12591890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jabacchetta","html_url":"https://github.com/jabacchetta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jabacchetta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jabacchetta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jabacchetta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jabacchetta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jabacchetta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jabacchetta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jabacchetta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jabacchetta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jabacchetta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":529237263,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MjkyMzcyNjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/settings-editor","name":"settings-editor","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":578047123,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NzgwNDcxMjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/under-discussion","name":"under-discussion","color":"dcdcdc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzg3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzg3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2019-06-16T19:51:42Z","updated_at":"2019-10-10T22:00:17Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"New VSCode users typically end up frustrated trying to get the editor to behave as they'd expect it to. A lot of times there is just a misunderstanding as to what the consequences might be when a setting is modified from its default state.\r\n\r\nOne way to improve this situation is to add more comprehensive descriptions to settings (even if it's a hidden description that needs to be expanded with a \"more\" button).\r\n\r\nIt also doesn't help that custom descriptions (via comments) [currently have](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/75599) their [own limitations](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/68184).\r\n\r\nBelow is an example of what my own comments look like for just a few of the settings in my settings.json file. This is a good snapshot of the problem that new users are facing.\r\n\r\n```json5\r\n{\r\n  // This only applies when quick suggestions are not active. Tab always completes the selected\r\n  // quick suggestion. Setting this to `onlySnippets` allows snippets to be tab completed faster (no\r\n  // need to wait for quick suggestions to appear).\r\n  \"editor.tabCompletion\": \"onlySnippets\",\r\n\r\n // Setting `snippetSuggestions` to `top` allows you to keep quick suggestions on, while also\r\n  // guaranteeing that you can enter a snippet prefix and immediately tab complete it. In other\r\n  // words, if quick suggestions appear before you've had a chance to tab, that snippet will be the\r\n  // first suggestion (as opposed to some local variable, for example), so tab will still insert the\r\n  // snippet. With this set to `top`, snippet prefixes should be kept short (3 characters or less),\r\n  // so that auto completing other useful suggestions like local variables does not require typing\r\n  // more than 4 characters.\r\n  \"editor.snippetSuggestions\": \"top\",\r\n\r\n // This only applies when quick suggestions are not active. Tab always completes quick\r\n  // suggestions, regardless of whether or not it's an Emmet abbreviation. Setting this to `true` is\r\n  // required for expanding / auto completing React components. Note that if setting this to `true`,\r\n  // Emmet will expand all words as custom tags when quick suggestions is not active (not just React\r\n  // component names).
