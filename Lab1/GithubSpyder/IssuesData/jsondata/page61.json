Vscode will immediately suggest `exception`, as expected.\r\nAnd now here is the weird part: Type `e`, and instead of still suggesting `exception`, it will suggest `error`!\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that once you type anything after the suggestion came, vscode will completely disregard your completion history and will just give you the best match lexicographically. Even if in the example you have completed `exception` by typing an `e` and then having it complete it, the same thing will occur.\r\nMy suggestion is that when you have already typed something, the 'suggest selection' will just be filtered by what you have typed, instead of stop working. So in the example, after you have typed `e`, it will still suggest `exception`.\r\n\r\n_\"Switch the Suggest Selection settings to \"recentlyUsedByPrefix\" and it will work!\"_\r\nYes it does make it sometimes work but overall it makes the situation much worse. For example if you type just `console.` it won't suggest exception no matter what you have done before.

https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/extensions/css-language-features/.vscode/launch.json\r\n\r\nProblem:\r\n\r\n- When I develop on css-language-features, I always run `yarn watch` in a terminal\r\n- When I press F5, VS Code still runs the `preLaunchTask`, which can take quite a while\r\n- Currently I comment out `preLaunchTask`, but I had to be careful not committing that to git\r\n- I don't want to use task, since the task compiles but without watching, so each time I make a change, I need to wait fo a full recompile\r\n- I can't just remove the `preLaunchTask`, since Martin uses it\r\n- If I start using tasks by converting the current `compile` task to use `watch`, this will work fine if I \"make change, then reload ExtHost window\", but this won't work when I stop debugging session, since the next time I debug I need to run the task again\r\n\r\nIn my own extension, I've completely removed tasks for exactly this reason:

Override the 'type' command with `vscode.commands.registerCommand`\r\n2. Call the default 'type' command instead of the custom command\r\n3. Note the difference in execution time in calling `vscode.commands.executeCommand('type', ...) ` when no custom type command has been registered, vs. calling `vscode.commands.executeCommand('default: type', ...)` (when a custom command has been registered/is overriding the default 'type' command). On my machine, the difference in execution time is consistently an order of magnitude (roughly 20ms vs 200ms) larger every time the executeCommand('default: type', ...) is called after overriding.\r\n\r\nI have included some of my machine details here just-in-case - although I do doubt that they play any part in the issue here.\r\n\r\nOne of VSCode's most popular plugins, VSCodeVim/Vim, has an issue experienced by a fair share of the VSCodeVim community, as can be seen in an issue raised over a year ago in their repo -  VSCodeVim/Vim#2021. Typing in an editor window whilst this plugin is enabled results in an unbearably slow character render time, for a range of slower (and perhaps sometimes slighty-faster-than-slow) machines. During a screen-share a little while ago with @shawnaxsom, a contributor to the VSCodeVim community, we boiled the problem down to the 'type' command being overridden, and then having the default type command executed afterwards. For example, from my understanding of the VSCodeVim extension, the 'type' command is overridden like so:\r\n\r\n`vscode.commands.registerCommand('type', async ...`\r\n\r\nThe default 'type' command is then called when needed, with code like this:\r\n\r\n`await vscode.commands.executeCommand('default:type', { text });`\r\n\r\nWe measured the time taken for an ordinary (non-overridden) execution of the type command (which was roughly 20ms on my machine), vs. then calling 'default: type' command, which was always roughly 10x slower. Even though I am not familiar with the extensions API, this is puzzling, since these two calls should be doing exactly the same thing, yet calling `executeCommand('default: type', ...)` results in a much slower execution time of the default type command. I guess it has been an assumption that the source code in the VSCodeVim extension has been responsible for the severe typing slowness (or, it has only been occurring on slow machines, since it does not occur for everyone using the extension), but our screenshare led us to the conclusion that it appears to be this part of the extensions API which seems to be responsible. I imagine, also, that the much-slower execution time also occurs on faster machines, but it is simply not noticeable due to the fact that the faster processing/graphical power prevents the comparably slower call to the 'type' command being made visible rendering-wise. Even though it shouldn't matter, It is perhaps worth mentioning too, that even if the overridden (type) command is doing minimal work, as far as I know (I think we also tested this), the significant execution time difference still occurs.\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/65864","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/65864/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/65864/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/65864/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/65864","id":394989505,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzOTQ5ODk1MDU=","number":65864,"title":"Executing user defined actions, one off extensions","user":{"login":"abdulkareemnalband","id":3139353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzkzNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3139353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdulkareemnalband","html_url":"https://github.com/abdulkareemnalband","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdulkareemnalband/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdulkareemnalband/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdulkareemnalband/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdulkareemnalband/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdulkareemnalband/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdulkareemnalband/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdulkareemnalband/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdulkareemnalband/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdulkareemnalband/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":343063018,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNDMwNjMwMTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/extensions","name":"extensions","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689392,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODkzOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"dcdcdc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2018-12-31T14:41:14Z","updated_at":"2019-01-03T08:24:30Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"### Search Terms\r\nmacro , userscripts , greasemonkey\r\n\r\n### Requirement\r\nAllow executing user defined javascript functions on code base, just like snippets\r\nSome repeated tasks can be automated using some small scripts, example advanced search/replace for refactoring\r\n\r\nAPI can be a function which takes a `context` object and returns a list of  `Operation` requests, then `vscode` internals can execute that operation.\r\nTo keep implementation robust and simple user action cannot have any side effects.

I'm switching to VS Code from Sublime Text 3 (for the superior Unity and TypeScript support), and the vscode-sublime-keybindings extension has made the transition very smooth. However, there is a macOS keyboard shortcut I frequently use that doesn't appear to be supported in VS Code yet. The shortcut is referred to as \"Shift-Option-Up Arrow\" and \"Shift-Option-Down Arrow\" in [this Apple community thread](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4738826):\r\n\r\n| Key combination | What it does |\r\n|----------------- |--------------|\r\n| Shift-Option-Up Arrow | Extend text selection to the beginning of the current paragraph, then to the beginning of the following paragraph if pressed again|\r\n| Shift-Option-Down Arrow | Extend text selection to the end of the current paragraph, then to the end of the following paragraph if pressed again|\r\n\r\nI primarily use this shortcut in Sublime Text 3, but it also works in other native macOS apps, like TextEdit:\r\n\r\n![desired-shortcut](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4952192/50533602-da2d1480-0afa-11e9-8033-f7966f40a737.gif)\r\n\r\nVS Code does support the similar \"Shift-Up Arrow\" and \"Shift-Down Arrow\" shortcuts, however the functionality isn't identical. Rather than moving the cursor to the beginning or end of the line, the cursor stays at the same column. Again, here's a demo of that shortcut in TextEdit for comparison:\r\n\r\n![existing-shortcut](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4952192/50533616-3001bc80-0afb-11e9-81c9-38019fa84942.gif)\r\n\r\nWhile searching for a way to enable the desired shortcut in VS Code, I discovered that [there are shortcuts for enabling this functionality in the VS Code terminal](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/46761):\r\n- `workbench.action.terminal.selectToPreviousLine`\r\n- `workbench.action.terminal.selectToNextLine`\r\n\r\nI looked at the [PR for those terminal shortcuts](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/47991/files) with the hope that I could take a similar approach to add support for them in the editor, but I see that the PR deals with terminal-specific code.\r\n\r\nI would love to see the \"select to next/previous line\" functionality available in the VS Code editor. If you know of a way of enabling that functionality, please let me know. In the meantime, I will switch to using a combination of \"Shift-Up Arrow\" and \"Cmd+Shift+Left Arrow\" to get the same behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/65795","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/65795/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/65795/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/65795/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/65795","id":394748773,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzOTQ3NDg3NzM=","number":65795,"title":"Panes

I would think we can remove the 2 rules in the widget itself (provided you drop in a rule for the standalone editor) and then we can even remove the third rule in `shell.css` possibly?\r\n\r\n**Missing Declarations**\r\n* issue reporter\r\n* process explorer\r\n\r\n@RMacfarlane both seem to declare the font as in `shell.css` (which is right because these are in separate windows) but miss the language specific overrides it seems (e.g. `:lang(ja)`, `:lang(ko)`, `lang(zh-Hans)`. If we support localization in these 2 windows as well, we need to have the same font rules. I also noticed that some fonts seem to be declared redundantly (e.g. `html` and `textarea`)\r\n\r\n//cc @jrieken
