Let me know if you can reproduce this.\r\n\r\nIt basically goes like this -\r\n\r\n1. Create an empty project that uses parcel.\r\n2. Create a `src/foo.js`\r\n3. Create a `src/bar.js`\r\n4. Open `foo.js` and add an `import bar from './bar.js'`\r\n5. Open an integrated terminal and start parcel. At this point parcel is rebuilding exceptionally quickly.\r\n6. Change your mind and create a folder `src/components`.\r\n7. Move `foo.js` to this folder.\r\n\r\nACTUAL: Parcel immediate rebuilds and errors out with can't find `import bar from './bar.js'`.\r\n\r\nEXPECT: Can Visual Studio move the file and update the imports in an atomic operation so you don't see build failures? \r\n\r\nThis is really easy to reproduce on small web projects running parcel. Parcel takes about 100 to 200 ms to build from what I've seen.\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code - Insiders 1.30.0-insider (9e62a05bc7c5dbb74d165e06f7c3a5f3c7549096, 2018-12-03T06:12:08.874Z)\r\nOS

Open a long document\r\n2. Scroll using two fingers on bootcamp macbook trackpad\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes\r\n\r\nI am running latest available vscode on windows 10 via bootcamp. I have all updates installed. If I try and scroll any portion of vscode using two finger scroll, then the the scrolling speed is incredibly high. Vscode will scroll maybe 5-10 lines at a time. This makes it unusable because even minor movement on the trackpad can scroll like 50 - 100+ lines of code!\r\n\r\nChanging the windows mouse wheel settings makes no difference. I currently have it set to 1.\r\n\r\nChanging `\"window.smoothScrollingWorkaround\"` and `\"window.titleBarStyle\"` makes no difference.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that helps is changing `\"editor.mouseWheelScrollSensitivity\"` to `0.3`. This is not viable because then when using a mouse attached to the laptop, the scrolling is too slow. I have to continuously modify this mouse setting when switching between working at desk and working mobile.\r\n\r\nNo matter what I try I am unable to get smooth or inertial scrolling working.\r\n\r\nI have read the other open issues and they seemed to have either been closed, \"fixed\" or don't apply to this

When adding new snippets, I want to see an option that when checked, will automatically expand the snippet for you. Now I know this can be done by creating a snippet and then binding a key to that snippet command. However, this is limiting since you can't type a string and get it auto expanded. Also, it's a lot more work.\r\n\r\nFor example when I type `class` I don't want to click tab or enter or choose the snippet suggestion from the widget. I want it to automatically expand to the defined snippet.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### This is the closest vscode is to achieving this, however as I said \"key\" is very limited.

10.0.15063\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n(Since this seems to be kind of finicky, I've added more details about how I select things and so on than I would ordinarily provide.)\r\n\r\n1. Change two different locations in a file.\r\n1. Select the changed lines in one location (with the mouse) and choose **Git: Stage Selected Ranges** from the palette (I open it with Ctrl-Shift-P).\r\n2. Fill in a commit message and commit the change by pressing Ctrl-Enter.\r\n3. Click off the previous selection and select the other change. Again choose **Git: Stage Selected Ranges** from the palette. *Do not do anything else in between* (sometimes the issue does not occur if you do other things).\r\n4. View the staged changes. In addition to the newly staged lines, an exact revert of the previous changes is present. This does get committed if you then commit, and it shows up in `git diff --cached`.\r\n\r\nThis happens pretty reliably, but only happened 75% of the times I was trying to reproduce it -- I assume I was doing something else in between or selecting something in a slightly different way the times it didn't happen.\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: **Yes**\r\n\r\n## Git output\r\n\r\nVSCode appears to be doing a lot of extra stuff the second time!\r\n\r\nOn staging the first change:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> git
