all!\r\n\r\nI would love to have an easy way to create workplace settings (.vscode/settings.json).\r\n\r\nI have a bunch of format_on_save rules + linting rules that I manually move from project to

Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nbefore last update, when i used to highlight a word by selecting it with mouse cursor then i used to get a little square in the side scrollbar for each occurrences of that word. Now, after last update, i'm no longer able to see the occurrences on the sidebar, i can see them if i just click a keyword (like funciton name, or variable) but if i select a part of a word or a word then i get all the occurrences highlited in the document but without little squars on the sidebar. please resolve.\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.38.1 (b37e54c98e1a74ba89e03073e5a3761284e3ffb0,
