Please ask it on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode.\r\n\r\nFor bug reports, please fill in the details below. For feature requests, please describe the desired feature.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Use Help > Report Issue to prefill these. -->\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.23.1\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10 (latest)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Paste in an xml or json or whatever you want with 20000+ characters\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes\r\n\r\nHello, I know that there is a 20k limit, so this is less of a bug, and more of a desired feature. It would be nice if it told the user \"Hey this file is huge and that is why it is not syntax highlighting\" then maybe you could tell it to ignore the 20k count and just highlight it all regardless of the time it takes. Then you keep your performance as well as allow it to work anyway.\r\n\r\nThis came up for me because I wanted to check a large xml for a value and wanted the syntax highlighting to help read it, but it simply didn't highlight, so I started deleting characters until I got down to 19999.\r\n\r\nIt would have been nice to at least know WHY it wasn't working, or allow me to tell it to simply work. It would also be nice to be able to set that 20k to something higher optionally.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/50047","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/50047/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/50047/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/50047/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/50047","id":324034970,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMjQwMzQ5NzA=","number":50047,"title":"Feature request: Allow Code Outline in Minimap location","user":{"login":"StevenLangbroek","id":296796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5Njc5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/296796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLangbroek","html_url":"https://github.com/StevenLangbroek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLangbroek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLangbroek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLangbroek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLangbroek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLangbroek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLangbroek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLangbroek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLangbroek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLangbroek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODkzOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"dcdcdc","default":false},{"id":934069566,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MzQwNjk1NjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/outline","name":"outline","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTQwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTQwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2018-05-17T13:57:16Z","updated_at":"2018-06-15T14:36:24Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm using the VS Code insiders build, which has Code Outline built in.

Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nIn my debug extension it frequently happens that debugging stops in multiple positions within a line. That's why I heavily depend on proper debug position markers.\r\n\r\nHowever the handling is currently not fully satisfying:\r\n\r\n1) For the first stop on a line the debug marker is never shown:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"857\" alt=\"debug1\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2398704/39967616-09ec37b4-56bf-11e8-9a6b-a81f1238e1a9.png\">\r\n\r\n2) Well, not always as this image shows:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"906\" alt=\"debug4\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2398704/39967629-381bf5b6-56bf-11e8-8c31-ecdf0e409085.png\">\r\n\r\n, but mostly it's missing. The difference here is that in case 1) this was the first stop on that line, while for 2) we have a recursive rule, so when I step-in the debugger ends up at the first rule name (the body of a rule begins after the colon). Pretty inconsistent. The debug marker should always show unless there is no column info (however my stack traces always has column info).\r\n\r\n3) Also within a line the marker shows up or not, depending on how a position was reached (not the position itself).\r\n\r\n_Reached the position after stepping into `identifier` and returned._\r\n<img width=\"932\" alt=\"debug2\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2398704/39967655-b82e80ac-56bf-11e8-8d20-b3757265f6ea.png\">\r\n\r\n_Reached the position after stepping over `identifier`._\r\n<img width=\"976\" alt=\"debug3\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2398704/39967676-3e88ab96-56c0-11e8-8b38-e9580d030470.png\">\r\n\r\n4) The debug marker is not shown for non-TOS elements in a call stack and the TOS loses the marker when navigating the call stack.\r\n\r\n![debug5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2398704/39967693-bc461884-56c0-11e8-8e33-bc023fc499cb.gif)\r\n\r\nAs you can here the marker before the `identifier` rule is lost when returning after selecting other than the TOS in the stack trace. That's a pretty bad thing as you totally lose where you came from. Imagine a rule body with 20 and more sub rule invocations, spread over multiple lines, which is very common in such grammar files.\r\n\r\nI guess 1) is implemented by intention to support languages that rarely use debug stops within a line, but I beg for an option to always show the debug markers and always respect the given column value!\r\n\r\nBtw: you can see this behavior also with the TS debugger, e.g. when you debug a for-loop, which is one of the rare occasions where a debug position within a line is used.\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.23.1

If you have two or more editor groups, the dial will only scroll in one of them. Even if you switch focus to another editor group, the first group is the only editor group that will scroll. It should follow the focus.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open a file in the editor.\r\n2. Open a second file in a new editor group. So you have two files open side by side.\r\n3. Focus the first file, and then use a Surface Dial to scroll up and down.\r\n4. Focus the second file, and then use a Surface Dial to scroll up and down.\r\n\r\n## Expected Result:\r\n\r\n * When the first file is focused, scrolling with the Surface Dial should scroll the first file up and down.\r\n * When the second file is focused, scrolling with the Surface Dial should scroll the second file up and down.\r\n\r\n## Actual Result:\r\n\r\n * When the first file is focused, scrolling with the Surface Dial scrolls the first file.\r\n * When the second file is focused, scrolling with the Surface Dial still scrolls the first file.\r\n * You can only scroll the first file using the dial. It's not respecting the focus.\r\n\r\nHappens with `--disable-extensions`.\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.23.0 (7c7da59c2333a1306c41e6e7b68d7f0caa7b3d45, 2018-05-03T16:44:55.614Z)\r\nOS version:
