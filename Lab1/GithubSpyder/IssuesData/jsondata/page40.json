page has a javascript error, for example 'unexpected end of input', this then gives the line and file of the error in Chrome dev tools.\r\nWhen i use Chrome dev tools to inspect the file with the error i can see that a small snippet from the end of my javascript appears to have been duplicated and popped in randomly afterwards.\r\n\r\nI've pasted example code below.\r\nThis can happen in multiple files and it always appears that it is the last part of my javascript that is duplicated and stuck in at the end of the file.\r\n\r\nIf i close down VS Code and reopen it i can see the duplicate code in the .js file. If i remove this from the file and save, the web page still has the error. Re-opening VS Code again still shows the code in the file, despite me removing it.\r\n\r\nI have tried disabling all the extensions i use and the issue still occurs.\r\nIf i roll back to version 1.20.1 the issue goes away.\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure what the problem is.\r\n\r\nIf any further info is needed please let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nIan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction

Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nFor this example I'll be using React.\r\n\r\nI have the following components;\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nimport styled from \"styled-components\";\r\n\r\ntype Justify = \"space-around\" | \"space-between\";\r\n\r\nexport const FlexBox = styled.div<{\r\n  column?: boolean;\r\n  justify?: Justify;\r\n}>`\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  flex-direction: ${props => (props.column ? \"column\" : \"row\")};\r\n  ${props => !!props.justify && `justify-content: ${props.justify}`}\r\n`;\r\n\r\nexport const Flex = styled.div<{ flex?: number }>`\r\n  flex: ${props => props.flex || 1};\r\n`;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I try to use them inside another component I do get an auto completion with the correct name whilst typing `FlexBox` but when I hit `enter` it doesn't import it (it does complete it), clicking on the suggestion with my mouse does work.\r\n\r\nHere's a video describing the

However, I scope my components with a namespace (e.g. `xapp-button`).\r\n\r\nI would like to have the ability to specify the prefix `xapp-` in one place in the file and reference it though a common variable. This would allow my to copy the snippets file and place it in another project, change `xapp-` in one place to, say, `xapp2-`.\r\n\r\nI completely realize a global find a replace accomplished this but I can see it being useful far beyond this simple use case. If snippets could reference variables, or other snippets, we could start creating composable snippets that contain other snippets letting us reduce the duplication of code and, when an issue is found or an enhancement is needed, thigs can be changed from a single location instead of all over the file.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this

background tasks where `activeOnStart` is `false` emits problems into the Problems pane, even if `beginsPattern` is not matched by the output. If begin/end patterns do match, then problems are shown immediately after the matching line(s) is output. But if they begin pattern doesn't match, then problems are still shown-- albeit after a few-second delay.\r\n\r\nI assume that this behavior is intentional as a fallback if begin/end patterns are missing. But if begin/end pattens are preset but incorrect (which will often be the case when building or troubleshooting task configs) then this behavior makes is really hard to debug the begin/end patterns because you don't know if they're working or not.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the problems that show up in this case cannot be removed until you close and re-open VSCode.  This means you can't tell the difference between a successful iteration of task config and left-over problems from the previous task run. If you're building a new task config, you might need 50+ iterations before getting the all the regexes right. Each iteration requires closing VSCode, reopening VSCode, re-opening the workspace, and re-running the task.  This is incredibly frustrating.\r\n\r\nInstead of the current behavior, I suggest that VSCode should not emit any problems if all the following conditions are satisfied:\r\n* `isBackground` is `true`\r\n* `activeOnStart` is `false`\r\n* `beginsPattern` is present (truthy)\r\n* `beginsPattern` is not matched by the task output\r\n\r\nChanging this behavior would make it clear whether a begin/end pattern pair is working or not, because if it's not working then no problems will show up in the problems pane.\r\n\r\nBTW if you want to see the current behavior with a test repo, here are repro steps: \r\n\r\n1. `git clone https://github.com/justingrant/problem-matcher-cra.git`\r\n2. `cd problem-matcher-cra`\r\n3. `npm install`\r\n4. break the `beginsPattern` in tasks.json, e.g. by replacing \"^\" with \"^xxxxx\" at the start of the `beginsPattern` regex and save the tasks.json file\r\n5. run the `npm start` task using the Debug->Run Task... menu\r\n\r\nExpected: no problems shown in the Problems pane (because `beginsPattern` doesn't match anything)\r\nActual: after a few-second delay, one problem is shown\r\n\r\n6. Now press CMD+C (or Ctrl+C on Windows) to quit the task. \r\n7. Break the `beginsPattern` in some other way, e.g. by changing \"xxxxx\" to \"yyyyy\". This simulates the normal, iterative process of building a problem matcher where you try different regxes until you get the right ones.\r\n8. Go to App.tsx and comment out this line of code: \r\n```typescript\r\nconst eslintWillComplain = 'foo';\r\n```\r\n9. Save that file, which will trigger a background recompilation. \r\n\r\nExpected: no errors shown in the Problems pane (because we just commented out the only line of code that was causing a problem) \r\nActual: the old problem persists, even though we've fixed the problem in code. \r\n\r\nOnce that persistent problem is shown, there's no way to get rid of it without closing and reopening VSCode or by running a working version of the task config, which you won't have because you generally only run into this problem when you don't (yet) have a working version of task config!"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/73194","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/73194/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/73194/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/73194/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/73194","id":439797454,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0Mzk3OTc0NTQ=","number":73194,"title":"Splitting

this issue was opened in vscode-go extension repo: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/2451\r\n\r\nMaintainer (@ramya-rao-a) asked to reopen it here.\r\n\r\nBy default, with `Ctrl-click` you go to symbol definition, f.e. to a function declaration. When you make `Ctrl-click` on a declared name, VS Code in fact does nothing, which seems counter-intuitive. In most of the cases I need to `Shift-F12` to see the usages of that symbol or if I want to go back from that place after some navigation happened around that symbol.\r\n\r\nI think it would be very useful, if when you `Ctrl-click` on a function, variable, or a type name in a place where the symbol is defined, `VS Code` will open a Peek References of that symbol. This would be close to what Goland does by default and what I personally found extremely helpful."}]
