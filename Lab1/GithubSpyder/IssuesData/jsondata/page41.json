Create a tasks.json file with a task that uses an input variable of say \"promptString\" and set it's default value to something.\r\n2. Invoking the script for the first populates with the default value - good so far.\r\n3. Change the value to something else.\r\n4. Invoke the task again and it gives the default instead of the last value entered.  That is very annoying.\r\n\r\nIf this is the defined behavior of `default` then maybe we need another field `initialDefault` or something like that that provides a default when there is no stored value.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I'm spoiled by using picker UI for debug launch configs.

Type: **Feature Request**\r\n\r\nI'm a collaborator of [vscode-leetcode](https://github.com/jdneo/vscode-leetcode) extension, and frequently there are rookies asking how to bind 'test' or 'submit'

Create two Functions. The upper Method should at least be to lines long. The second one should be at least three lines long which mustn't be empty. However the more non-empty lines there are the more pronounced the effect is.\r\n\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24353680/56723055-84831480-6748-11e9-87cb-3f6cb9e8c49d.png)\r\n\r\n2.

The same is true for any combination of objects and functions as long as they are longer than one line. \r\nb) This effect stops when you and the indentation resets when you move below an empty line. That being said, the effect continues as long as there isn't a new line, even when already have move below the initially entered object/function.\r\nc) The effect is also cancelled and the indentation level is reset when you move the line up (editor.moveLinesUpAction). Moving lines up in general doesn't produce the bug at all.\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.33.1 (51b0b28134d51361cf996d2f0a1c698247aeabd8, 2019-04-11T08:27:09.080Z)\r\nOS version: Windows_NT ia32

like the way that sublime text has a unified search / replace bar for all open tabs. The search is executed on the tab with focus. Usually when I'm searching, I'm searching for the same text across multiple files. In VS Code, this happens:\r\n\r\n-> Search in one tab\r\n-> Switch to another, open search\r\n-> Realize I need the search term from the other tab\r\n-> Mouse over to the other tab. Select the search term, copy.\r\n-> Go back to my original tab.\r\n-> Paste and search again\r\n\r\nThis is tedious and interrupts my workflow. A \"Sync Search\" or \"Unified Search\" option would be very helpful.
