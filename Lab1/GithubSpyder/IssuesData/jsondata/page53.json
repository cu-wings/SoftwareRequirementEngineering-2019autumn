Respond to an LSP hover with a MarkupContent of kind `plaintext` with visually significant whitespace.\r\n2. See hover formatted improperly in the editor.\r\n\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: N/A\r\n\r\nThe Python extension uses `vscode-languageclient` to communicate with a language server over LSP. The LSP has support for `plaintext` as a markup kind in many calls, for example, hover. `vscode-languageclient` converts `MarkupContent` of kind `plaintext` to VS Code's `MarkdownString` by using `appendText` to append the text as is:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node/blob/5a198a0982e3d8f538a2f30fa87eb4ca27f1728d/client/src/protocolConverter.ts#L294-L297\r\n\r\nWhich is implemented as:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/527b6628e6bdcb046a31bbcb0cd17c3702c4ee8a/src/vs/base/common/htmlContent.ts#L24-L28\r\n\r\nHowever, escaping these special characters isn't enough to convert plaintext to something that's rendered properly in markdown. For example, the following Python code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef func(param1=True, param2='default val'):\r\n    '''Description of func with docstring groups style.\r\n\r\n    Params:\r\n        param1 - descr of param1 that has True for default value.\r\n        param2 - descr of param2\r\n\r\n    Returns:\r\n        some value\r\n\r\n    Raises:\r\n        keyError: raises key exception\r\n        TypeError: raises type exception\r\n\r\n    '''\r\n    pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nCould produce, on hover of `func`, the following LSP response:\r\n\r\n```json\r\nResult: {\r\n    \"contents\": {\r\n        \"kind\": \"plaintext\",\r\n        \"value\": \"func(param1=True, param2='default val')\\n\\nDescription of func with docstring groups style.\\n\\n    Params:\\n        param1 - descr of param1 that has True for default value.\\n        param2 - descr of param2\\n\\n    Returns:\\n        some value\\n\\n    Raises:\\n        keyError: raises key exception\\n        TypeError: raises type exception\\n\\n    \"\r\n    },\r\n    \"range\": {\r\n        \"start\": {\r\n            \"line\": 0,\r\n            \"character\": 4\r\n        },\r\n        \"end\": {\r\n            \"line\": 0,\r\n            \"character\": 8\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe signature is on the first line, followed by the docstring unmodified.

is the vscode insider version where i tried java multiple threads program.

Add two breakpoints at line 14 and line 27. When exec `next`, it doesn't auto switch thread focus, this is expected. But when exec `continue`, the thread focus always stay on one thread, not auto jump to other suspend threads.\r\n\r\n <details><summary> ThreadTest.java</summary>\r\n<pre>\r\nimport java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;\r\n\r\npublic class ThreadTest {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {        \r\n        Object object = new Object();\r\n        AtomicInteger ai = new AtomicInteger();\r\n        Thread thread0 = new Thread(() -> {\r\n            for (;;) {\r\n                System.out.println(String.format(\"Print %d in thread 0\" , ai.incrementAndGet()));\r\n                synchronized(object) {\r\n                    object.notify();\r\n                }\r\n                try {\r\n                    Thread.sleep(1000);\r\n                } catch (InterruptedException e) {\r\n                    e.printStackTrace();\r\n                    break;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {\r\n            for (;;) {\r\n                try {\r\n                    synchronized(object) {\r\n                        object.wait();\r\n                    }\r\n                    System.out.println(String.format(\"Print %d in thread 1\" , ai.incrementAndGet()));\r\n                } catch (InterruptedException e) {\r\n                    e.printStackTrace();\r\n                    break;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        thread0.start();\r\n        thread1.start();\r\n        thread0.join();\r\n        thread1.join();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n</details>\r\nBelow are the reproduce steps in vscode-insider:\r\n\r\n1. Add two breakpoints at line 14 and line 27.\r\n2. Start java debug, there are two breakpoints hit at line 14 (thread-0) and 27 (thread-1).\r\n3. Select thread-0 to continue, line 14 will be hit again and the focus always stay on thread-0. The focus never switch to thread-1.  As comparison, try the same steps both in eclipse and intellij, click `continue` and it will switch back and forth between thread-0 and thread-1.  I think we should maintain a queue to store all suspend threads, every time when exec `continue`, pop one. And a new breakpoint event arrives, push it.\r\n\r\nThe focus switch problem is important because java supports Thread Level suspend, that means you can choose to `continue` one stopping thread, and keep other threads still on stopping state. Other languages, like nodejs, continue will resume the whole program, so it doesn't need care about the focus switch.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/68939","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/68939/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/68939/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/68939/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/68939","id":411612432,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MTE2MTI0MzI=","number":68939,"title":"Use Docker for remote linting","user":{"login":"tap52384","id":647983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzk4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/647983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tap52384","html_url":"https://github.com/tap52384","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tap52384/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tap52384/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tap52384/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tap52384/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tap52384/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tap52384/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tap52384/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tap52384/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tap52384/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODkzOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"dcdcdc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"chrmarti","id":9205389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMDUzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9205389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti","html_url":"https://github.com/chrmarti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"chrmarti","id":9205389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMDUzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9205389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti","html_url":"https://github.com/chrmarti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2019-02-18T19:14:09Z","updated_at":"2019-03-06T08:17:03Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->\r\n\r\nWe can use Docker for remote debugging; it would be awesome to be able to use Docker for remote linting as well.

This closes the workspace in the \"hot exit\" way and puts it on a list of \"put away workspaces\" (in the File menu or via a command). When you choose the workspace from this list, it opens (potentially in a new window) and is removed from the list. This allows intentional use of hot exit while minimizing the risk of changes being lost.\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nI commonly use VS Code for a number of different projects that I work on when I find the time, and hot exit is a good way to leave things where they are and get back to them later. Right now, I have to use multiple windows to get hot exit for all projects. (Keeping multiple windows open increases the resource load dramatically, especially with .NET Core projects, which each kick off OmniSharp for the background windows.) According to [a comment on issue #15467](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15467#issuecomment-272853284), Close Folder should work to hot exit only one window, but it doesn't work for me, maybe because the issue pre-dates multiple-folder workspaces, or maybe because it's been changed since - hot exit is supposed to \"just work\", and feels like magic when it does and frustration when it doesn't.\r\n\r\nAllowing intentional, selective hot exit would let me retain the changes for later, but might make it easier to forget about changes, and because folders and files are easily opened day-to-day in VS Code, the activity in the recent list can scroll them off the bottom. Having a \"Put away\" command to hot exit a workspace, combined with putting the workspace on a manually kept list from which it may be later chosen surfaces intentional, selective hot exit while providing a reasonable safety net.\r\n\r\n## Counterarguments (or: Hot exit considered harmful)\r\n\r\nInstead of asking hot exit to save me, in an ideal world, I should just keep my stuff more organized, and/or use git and branching. However, that's an argument against hot exit overall. In a world where hot exit *does* exist, I should be able to use it in an intentional way."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/68828","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/68828/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/68828/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/68828/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/68828","id":411059763,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MTEwNTk3NjM=","number":68828,"title":"Selecting

Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nWhen a debug session is started from a text editor bound to a file system provider like `vscode-sshfs`, the debugger is initialized with `DebugProtocol.InitializeRequestArguments.pathFormat` set to `path` (and vscode-debugadapter also does not support any other `pathFormat`). Perhaps as a consequence, e.g. `DebugProtocol.SetBreakpointsArguments` then also contain only the path component of the actual address.\r\n\r\nSince URI support is present in other APIs, say,\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n  let uri = vscode.Uri.parse('ssh://example.org/example/example.pl');\r\n  vscode.workspace.openTextDocument(uri).then(\r\n    doc => vscode.window.showTextDocument(doc)\r\n  );\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if debugging features also had support for them, especially before users come to rely on the current broken behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe use case here is simplified remote debugging, I would like to connect a remote workspace folder using a file system provider like `vscode-sshfs` and then start a remote debug session without the need to configure elaborate path mappings and without the need to somehow synchronize local sources and remotely deployed code.\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.31.0 (7c66f58312b48ed8ca4e387ebd9ffe9605332caa,
