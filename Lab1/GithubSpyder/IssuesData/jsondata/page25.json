we are experiencing weird behaviour with VSCode and Win10 at the office.\r\nMy co-worker and I both have the same machines with Windows 10 1809 installed and noticed that VSCode will eventually soft freeze the whole operating system.\r\n\r\nOnce the system is frozen (by reproducing using the steps), all windows except for Google chrome and chromium based applications (Google Chrome, Slack, VSCode) are visually responsive, but nothing else happens when interacting with the operating system or UI elements - just as if someone pulled the plug from the SSD/HDD. For example: Launching a shell and trying to ping results in the cmd window freezing.\r\n\r\nWe will have to hard reboot our machines TWICE - rebooting once does not work, as Windows 10 will stay on the grey loading screen (with the spinner) forever - or even randomly lock out the drive and ask for a bitlocker recovery key (but not after the second (!) reboot).\r\n\r\nThis issue may be related to #49425 , but should be fixed by now with Windows 10 1809 ?!\r\nWIN+CTRL+SHIFT+B doesn't help here :)\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.36.1\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10 Enterprise 1809\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open Google Chrome\r\n2. Open VSCode\r\n3.

As part of LLVM, I work on the `clangd` C++ language server, which has a [vscode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd).\r\n\r\nMicrosoft also has the [vscode-cpptools](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cpptools) language server for C++.\r\n\r\nWe've noticed that the recommended extension system makes it hard to get clangd set up and keep it working. I'm sure this wasn't the intent - it's a great system for getting new users set up with working tools. However, there's a few interacting issues here here:\r\n - the `vscode-cpptools` and `clangd` extensions conflict in various ways, and can't be used together\r\n - the `vscode-cpptools` extension is recommended to anyone opening a c++ file (fair enough)\r\n - the `vscode-cpptools` extension is called only \"C/C++\" in the recommendation dialog, which is confusing to users that want C/C++ support from a different language server\r\n - the `vscode-cpptools` extension continues to be recommended when opening C++ files, even once `vscode-clangd` is installed.\r\n\r\nIn practice, we've found that a very large fraction of new VSCode users specifically trying to install clangd end up with both extensions installed and active eventually, and we need to include explicit instructions about how to remove this plugin.\r\n\r\nSo a couple of suggestions, which I don't think will hurt the new-user path or adoption of recommended extensions:\r\n - Allow extension metadata to include a list of UUIDs for conflicting extensions (like the opposite of `extensionDependencies`). This would suppress recommendation of that extension, and potentially allow VSCode to flag conflicts between installed extensions to the user.\r\n - Include the publisher name when prompting to install a recommended extension. e.g. `The 'C/C++' extension from Microsoft is recommended for this file type`. This makes the scope clearer to the user I think.\r\n\r\n(#77957 will improve this experience a little for users who understand what's going on, but I don't think is sufficient.)"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77977","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77977/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77977/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77977/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/77977","id":473250478,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NzMyNTA0Nzg=","number":77977,"title":"[html]
