\r\n\r\nIn this case a typical pattern is ...\r\n- start build task\r\n- spot error report in early build output\r\n- edit offending file\r\n- run build task again \r\n\r\nAt this stage if the original build task is still running a dialog is presented giving the option to terminate/restart.  \r\n\r\nIf 'restart' is chosen but the task completed while the dialog was being presented, you get another error saying the task couldn't be terminated. (Although this may be technically correct, failing to terminate because the task has already closed doesn't really seem like something worth reporting.)\r\n\r\nReally the behaviour I want is for CTRL-B to just terminate any current build tasks and start a new one unconditionally.  Perhaps there is a way to customise preferences to get this behaviour?

the releases of Visual Studio Code 1.31 and the ability to install, remove, and disable _most_ extensions without needing to restart (which, by the way, is an awesome feature addition to Code!), it now becomes troublesome to know which extensions have been recently updated (if automatic updating of extensions is turned on). This could help in narrowing down what extensions _may_ be causing a problem with VS Code due to a recent update, especially for Insiders builds.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I propose a new pre-defined filter in the Extensions activity pane search box: **`@installed:recentlyupdated`**. What does \"recent\" mean? Good question. Perhaps a good starting point is somewhere between 1 - 2 weeks ago from the current

For example:\r\n\r\n```vue\r\n<template></template>\r\n<script></script>\r\n<style></style>\r\n\r\n<docs>\r\n# This might be markdown or json, depending on user's build configuration\r\n</docs>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOur approach was:\r\n\r\n- Give a setting `vetur.grammar.customBlocks`\r\n- Register a command to recompile the TextMate grammar with the custom blocks\r\n- Write the file to extension directory, the same path as the one specified in `package.json`\r\n\r\n![vetur](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4033249/32684742-a9d5fa72-c63b-11e7-8742-ced7166b4ef4.gif)\r\n\r\nThis has been working, but I'm worried extension integrity check might kick in and ask for reinstall. Also @sandy081 mentioned updates remove the old folder, so it's bad to keep states in extension directory.\r\n\r\nWhat I need is a path that I can:\r\n- Statically determine in write-time (as the path is specified in `package.json`)\r\n- Have write permission\r\n\r\nSo the paths in `ExtensionContext` wouldn't work for me.\r\n\r\nAfter checking with @sandy081, we think offering an API like `languages.setGrammar` would be best. We considered allowing path interpolations like `${globalStoragePath}/grammars/vue.json` in `package.json`, but that means the best Vetur can do is to write to that path on first activation, so no coloring before first activation/reload.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm not sure we should provide an API tied to TextMate grammar. Also the API means the dynamically generated TextMate grammar wouldn't be loaded until extension activation.\r\n\r\n@alexandrudima What do you think?

removes multiple empty lines (2 or more) and converts them to a single line, it ignores lines at the end of file. \r\n\r\nYou can see the code here https://gist.github.com/madprops/618144596d21c26930bae831ab02fb18\r\n\r\nNow the problem is that while testing it, it counts the sets of empty lines fine, but when it comes to removing them I found a weird behavior, which I'm still not sure how to accurately reproduce.\r\n\r\nIf I start filling an empty document with text and linebreaks to test it, emptying it and starting again sometimes, the remove function fails, some of the multiple line sections are cut to 2 or 3 lines, instead of one. \r\n\r\nIt could easily seem it's a problem with my extension, but the thing is, if I open another document and paste the exact document with the problem, all the empty line segments get trimmed perfectly. Then I try again in the document with the problem and the problem is still there.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm thinking is that something is getting corrupted by editing the document (typing, hitting enter, copy/paste). Because on new documents with the same text pasted it works fine.\r\n\r\nA document with the problem can look like this: https://paste.ee/p/Smfqa\r\nAfter applying the remove lines function: https://paste.ee/p/aIJl7 (notice the double empty lines near the end)\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to replicate this all the time, I just try to replicate it by following a certain

Something along the lines: \"Could not resolve module reducers. Path ./reducers not found.\"\r\n\r\nI had encountered this issue many times before with previous versions of Expo in which the Metro Bundler cache would not update correctly and it would not recognize the creation of a new folder. I believed the problem to be related to the cache and my colleague and I spent half a day researching the issue on Google and StackOverflow.\r\n\r\nEventually, we realized that my colleague had accidentally included a space at the end of the folder name as follows: \"reducers \".

Extensions Management UX\r\n\r\nExtensions Management include:\r\n\r\n- Managing installed extensions\r\n  - Enabled\r\n  - Disabled\r\n  - All installed\r\n  - Built in\r\n  - Outdated\r\n\r\n- Browsing Marketplace\r\n  - Searching\r\n  - Categories\r\n  - Order of viewing\r\n\r\n- Show Recommendations\r\n  - Workspace\r\n  - General (file)\r\n\r\nOver the time this viewlet has become a single place for all of the above which made it \r\n\r\n- Flooded with views and making them hard to manage\r\n- Hard to distinguish among installed, recommendations and market place \r\n- Missing prominent information on installed extensions\r\n  - Active\r\n  - Running\r\n  - Activation time\r\n- Viewlet is lacking space to provide necessary information like \r\n  - Why reload is required\r\n  - Due to this fact, we have a different page for running extensions\r\n- There is no nice landing page\r\n- Hard to browse extensions in market place with categories\r\n\r\n\r\nThis seems like

Extensions being collapsed by default causes discoverability issues for some extensions and some extensions already try to work around this using `reveal` on the tree view.\r\n\r\nI propose adding an \"expanded\" property on the views contribution point that allows extensions to set the default behavior. If not set, the default behavior is the same as now. One thing to note is that if extensions opt-in to expanding, this will cause them to activate on startup if their containing viewlet is open."}]
