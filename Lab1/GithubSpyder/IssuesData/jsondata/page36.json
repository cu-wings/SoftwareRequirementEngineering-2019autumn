Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->\r\n<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->\r\n\r\nWhen word wrapping is enabled and the first character that does not fit on a line is a whitespace, the space is rendered as the first character on the new line. This creates a fake indentation that, while not being an issue or breaking the workflow, can be annoying. Other text editors usually don't exhibit this behaviour.\r\n\r\nFor clarity, consider this paragraph:\r\n\r\n![vscode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32854170/58620319-b430b980-82be-11e9-9d66-0ebed50dfee1.PNG)\r\n\r\nThe second line of the paragraph ends with \"veniam, \", with the space being the first character not to fit on the line. As such, the line is wrapped just after the comma and the space is rendered as the first character on the third line. Compare it with Notepad++ (same font, same fontsize):\r\n\r\n![npp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32854170/58620397-e0e4d100-82be-11e9-9c7a-c6060d4ded75.PNG)\r\n\r\nThe second line would end at \"veniam, \" as well, but the word is wrapped after the previous whitespace, after \"ad minim \", and the space between \"veniam,\" and \"quis\" is still rendered.\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/74604","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/74604/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/74604/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/74604/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/74604","id":450184460,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NTAxODQ0NjA=","number":74604,"title":"Terminal

Probably not the best place to ask this but IDK anywhere else to talk to [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft) Devs\r\n\r\n## Prelogue\r\nPrior to the [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft)'s acquisition Github was working on [Xray](https://github.com/atom/xray), a next-gen IDE that had all of the application logic completely in [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) and treat the UI as an extremely thin layer that interacts with the app via an async channel. They also made sure to use [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) for all of their UI javascript code. This combination of [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) and  [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) obviously creates a beautiful, statically-typed, async, concurrent code base that are designed at the language level to be fast and guarantee memory safety.\r\n\r\n## Why it was awesome\r\nIt undoubtedly would have been able to boot many times faster and out perform any electron based IDE by a large magnitude while using a fraction of the memory. \r\n\r\n## The Question\r\nMy question is does [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft) have any plans of\r\n<b>A. Reviving the [Xray](https://github.com/atom/xray) project</b>\r\nor\r\n<b>B. Creating a similarly IDE</b>\r\n\r\n## Super Reaching\r\nAlso would be super cool if you considered designing such an editor that implemented [Web-view](https://github.com/Boscop/web-view) or [azul](https://github.com/maps4print/azul) so that you could continue to use typescript/javascript for the UI without requiring Electron, making the application even lighter.\r\n\r\n## PS\r\nI believe [VSCode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) is very fast considering it's almost entirely written in typescript but I think it may be close to, or already is, the fastest it can be given the language that it is written in. I am asking you this today because [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft) the last couple of years has shown itself to be more of a forward thinking, open to open-source, and a creator of some pretty cool things (i.e.  [VSCode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode), [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript), [Bosque](https://github.com/microsoft/BosqueLanguage)).\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/74393","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/74393/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/74393/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/74393/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/74393","id":448751570,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NDg3NTE1NzA=","number":74393,"title":"Allow
