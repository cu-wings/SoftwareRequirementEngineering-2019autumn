build task to compile my code, I would like a keyboard shortcut that will open the location of the first/next compile error by opening the file and jumping to the line.\r\n\r\nThis command should ignore non build related errors and warning (from linters / intellisense).

Create a file system watcher that monitors adds/removes:\r\n```TypeScript\r\n...\r\n        const watcher = vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher('**/*.csproj*');\r\n        const createRegistration = watcher.onDidCreate(async (uri: vscode.Uri) => {\r\n            console.log('CSProj added: ' + uri.toString());\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        const deleteRegistration = watcher.onDidDelete(async (uri: vscode.Uri) => {\r\n            console.log('CSProj removed: ' + uri.toString());\r\n        });\r\n...\r\n```\r\n2.

am often debugging both an extension and attaching to an lsp server and I find the current ui/ux frustrating when constantly switching between them. Having to use the dropdown on the Debug sidebar to switch between running the extension vs attaching to the lsp server is imo less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI would love to see something like the following (one or more of them):\r\n1. a way of defining shortcut keys to launch specific configs (ideally per workspace)\r\n1. a way to make a config(s) the default (like tasks) -- so that F5 would ALWAYS run that config, and if there were more than 1 default, it would open a quickpick with the set of defaults (again just like build tasks when you hit Ctrl+Shift+B)\r\n1. in lieu of the default above, another option would be a way to start a launch config without switching the selected launch config -- e.g. I start debugging the extension (so the dropdown is the extension), then I want to attach to the lsp server so I run something like `workbench.action.debug.selectandstart` but it *shouldn't* change the selection. So that when I stop debugging and I hit F5 again, it runs the extension rather than attaching to a not running lsp server.\r\n1. Coupled with the one above, would be nice to be able to have F5, if the debugger wasn't paused (BP or otherwise), open a quickpick of launch configs (not by default, but something that can be made to

discussing this with @bpasero, we've come up with the following steps for the list widget. Let's forget about the current tree widget as we'll soon kill it and the new one is built on top of the list\r\n\r\n- [ ] Element focus should be an internal list concept (there should be no `setFocus` or `getFocus` methods). Interaction with the list should be configurable per device: mouse vs keyboard. The following two list options should be introduced:\r\n  - `singleClickSelection` (defaults to `true`) will configure whether single clicking a tree element would set it to selection. Double click will always set it to selection.\r\n  - `lightKeyboardNavigation` (defaults to `true`) will configure whether keyboard navigation would set elements to be focused vs. selected.\r\n- [ ] When not using a keyboard controller, the list should add the set of focused elements to the keyboard event which will bubble to the outside.\r\n- [ ] The keybinding service should forward that extra event information to the command which is about to execute. This way, list commands always have the correct context when running.\r\n- [ ] The `List` selection events should forward the related browser events which caused those selection changes.\r\n- [ ] The `WorkbenchList` is responsible for mapping **selection** events into **open** events. It should also expose a `open()` method which commands can call into.\r\n- [ ] The `WorkbenchList` is also responsible for listening to the proper workbench configurations and configure the `List` accordingly.\r\n- [ ] List/tree widget users should only rely on `open` events and forget about focus and selection altogether.\r\n- [ ] All the `focusNext`, etc, calls should be renamed to `navigateNext`. The only remaining calls of those would be `getSelection()` and `setSelection()`.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22350/46743105-a1726180-cca8-11e8-88f6-c856ed93eecc.png)\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/60489","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/60489/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/60489/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/60489/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/60489","id":368575877,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNjg1NzU4Nzc=","number":60489,"title":"[html]
