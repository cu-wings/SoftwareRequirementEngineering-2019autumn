use two git repositories within project folder - one is `.git` and second is `.git_dev`. First is for project and second is to track my local config files. I used to work with second via alias `git dev` which stands for `git --git-dir=.git_dev`, but for now I explore ways to list changes within both repos in git sideview.\r\n\r\nWhat I did: \r\n1. I create folder aside the main project folder(consider it `project`) and call it `project_dev`\r\n2. Initialize new repo in new folder with `git init --separate-git-dir ../project/.git_dev`. It creates file `project_dev/.git` with related line.\r\n3. Then create new file within `project_dev` folder and open it in Code. Now I'm able to view changes for both repos, but one called `project_dev` tracks the `project_dev` folder, not the `project`\r\n4. So my next step is to add setting `worktree=/path/to/project` in `.git_dev/cofig`. Now git sideview perfectly represents current changes for `project_dev` aside to main `project`.\r\n\r\nAnd here I run into two issues:\r\n1. if I try to click on changed file in `project_dev` section of sideview, an error occurs with message: `Unable to open 'filename (Working Tree)': Unable to read file (Error: File not found (/path/to/project_dev/filename)).` like it doen't respect setting `worktree` at all.\r\n2. If I reload Code, even if I open file from `project_dev` folder, second repo is not shown. If I remove `worktree` setting, `project_dev` repo is shown again and I have to add `worktree` setting again to get changes properly.\r\n\r\nExample repo:\r\nhttps://github.com/deitry/vscode-two-git-repos-issues\r\n\r\n---\r\nSo, on the one hand I consider current behaviour as buggy. On the other hand, I make a request to add option to pass as many `--git-dir`s as I want by making it a list:\r\n```\r\n\"git.gitdirs: [ \".git\", \".git_dev\"]\r\n```"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77214","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77214/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77214/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77214/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/77214","id":466898812,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NjY4OTg4MTI=","number":77214,"title":"Have

Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\n## How to reproduce\r\n\r\nUsing the french locale for VSCode (I insist this is *not* a problem specific to the french language pack), search for a command containing `’` (the Unicode apostrophe character). Now search for a command containing `'` (the ASCII quote character, often used for apostrophes). \r\n\r\nThe results are different between the two searches, because the search algorithms consider one apostrophe to be different from the other (even though they have the same meaning), some commands containing an apostrophe are therefore hidden from users depending on whether they use the correct apostrophe or not.\r\n\r\n## Why this is important\r\n\r\nNot everyone is able to type a typocorrect apostrophe. On the opposite hand, I am using a (AFNOR-normalised) bépo keyboard layout, which favors the typocorrect one (the ASCII one is hidden behind an AltGr modifier, making it less natural to type). This is a different character than the ASCII quote usually used as an apostrophe `'`.\r\n\r\nSince the use of apostrophes is incoherent amongst translators and extension makers, I am very often missing results from my searches.\r\n\r\n## What would be nice\r\n\r\n1. To strip “special” characters (e.g.: `'`, `’`, `(`, `@`, etc.) and/or normalise the command names while running a search (e.g.: `é` becomes equivalent to `e`, `’` to `'`, etc.) so that it is more tolerant towards the use of special characters, diacritics and punctuation, depending on the locale used.\r\n2. To harmonise locales so that they are always using the typocorrect apostrophe for a prettier and more uniform aspect.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code - Insiders 1.37.0-insider

current tokenisation story of VS Code is based on TM grammars, which are pretty powerful, but we are running into their limits if we want to do something more than a top-down scanner can do. Also, once you implement a TM interpreter, you realise how inefficient the way in which regular expressions must be evaluated is and how TM grammars were not meant to do much more than simple colouring using just a few rules... The fact that we now have these complex grammars than end up producing beautiful tokens is more of a testament to the amazing computing power available to us than to the design of the TM grammar semantics.\r\n\r\nAt the time when TM grammars were introduced and became popular there were no language servers available which understand the semantics of a language. Therefore, TM grammars were also used to colour semantic constructs. The introduction of LSP has brought us language servers for many languages and it we want to leverage this power to reduce the complexity of the tokenizer/classifier. There is already effort under way to specify how such API might look under LSP at https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node/pull/367\r\n\r\nIn any case, for smarter languages where we offer great extensions, such as for TypeScript or C++, we have noticed two different patterns emerge to try and compensate for these limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Complex TM grammar approach (TypeScript)\r\nThis approach was taken by TypeScript, where we now have immense regular expressions, which are a testament to the smartness of the author, but which are potentially very slow to evaluate on the UI thread:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5047891/62771189-eddf2700-ba9c-11e9-9263-604ad468deb2.png)\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n#### Text Editor Decorations (C++)\r\nThis approach was taken by C++, where we now receive potentially unbounded amounts of text editor decorations used to represent semantic tokens which are pushed by the C++ extension to correct or enhance the TM grammar. The limits of text editor decorations start to show, I have collected some of the issues under [this query](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Asemantic-coloring). Due to their memory cost, complexity, and breadth of usage (i.e. cannot touch the editing logic around them at this point), text editor decorations are not the right tool for this job...\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBoth approaches show that there is a real need for something more, and that folks which care can get really creative and smart in tackling this need even when we lack as a platform. This issue is about overhauling how tokenization works in VS Code and tries to address multiple goals at once:\r\n\r\n#### 1. Move tokenization off the UI thread\r\n\r\nToday, TM tokenization runs on the UI thread. Even more interesting, we have numerous features (such as typing a `}` or typing `(`, `'`, `\"`, etc) where we need to know synchronously, at the time we interpret the typed character if we are in a comment, in a string, in a regex, or somewhere else... So we have code paths were we end up tokenizing the current line synchronously given the line above is tokenized in order to find out what's the exact context that we are in and then we make a decision based on that.\r\n\r\nWe have looked into this and built a prototype where we removed the synchronous tokenization... Moving this kind of classification off the UI thread entirely would result in severe flakiness... In other words, *sometimes* pressing `'` would insert `'|'` and sometimes only `'|`, in the same file, in the same location, based purely on typing speed and the time it takes to send tokens over from the web worker. Having an editor where typing something does one thing 90% of the time and another thing 10% of the time based on typing speed would IMHO be completely unacceptable.\r\n\r\nAs a one-off approach, we have written a fast classifier for comments, strings or regexes for TS, in TS. We will experiment to see if this classifier could be used synchronously on the UI thread to determine what to do when typing these characters (`}`, `'`, etc). The challenge here lies with making it incremental (not start from the beginning of the file for each keystroke). Also, since these syntax constructs are \"rare\" relative to the entire body of text, a line based representation would not be a good one. Even more ideas are that perhaps we shouldn't store the location of strings, comments, etc. but only the save-points between them given the classifier would be fast enough to compute them again.\r\n\r\nAnother idea circulating was to enable writing monarch classifiers and contributing them from extensions. This would avoid some of the bad design choices of TM, but would still mean evaluating regexes written by extensions on the UI thread. Yet another idea was to have a \"fast\" TM grammar that only deals with strings, comments and regexes and another normal one for tokens -- again with the same problem of running regexes written by extension on the UI thread. Another idea was to build some base parser, with components such as C-style comments, C-style strings, etc which could be exercised by extensions (i.e. some kind of higher-order constructs than regexes). Or maybe we should just hand write parsers for the top 90% of our languages to detect strings, comments and regexes... We have not yet taken any clear decision as we still need to experiment in this area to learn more...\r\n\r\n#### 2. Accept tokens from the extension host (semantic tokenization)\r\n\r\nMoving TM grammars off the UI thread is good for reducing our freezes and crashes, but still does not address the fundamental limitations of TM. Here we need to add API such that semantic tokens can be pushed by the extension host. These tokens should very much behave similar to text editor decorations, but have a different implementation where we can represent them with a lot less memory (just 2 or 3 32bit numbers like we do with the other tokens). We should also tweak the way they are adjusted around typing to make most sense for tokens...\r\n\r\nThey also need to be updateable incrementally and only as needed. There are discussions of using the visible ranges APIs to prioritize the regions which should receive semantic tokens first. We have not yet began drafting an API nor a reference implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### 3. (low priority) Enable the integration of other tokenization engines \r\n\r\nThis is just here to remind us to keep in mind that we might want to move away from the inefficient TM grammars completely at one point in the future. There is a lot of love for Tree-Sitter nowadays and we might want to investigate using it, or we might want to roll our own story, since we do actually have a lot of experience in this area...\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n#### Tasks\r\n- [x] write a fast TS classifier of comments, strings, regex (done [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/4e23501dfa0713c8b2ba5aabe360722509f16a2b/src/vs/editor/common/modes/tokenization/typescript.ts) with tests [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/4e23501dfa0713c8b2ba5aabe360722509f16a2b/src/vs/editor/test/node/classification/typescript-test.ts) )\r\n- [ ] integrate the fast TS classifier and use it for synchronous classification instead of the TM engine\r\n  - [ ] figure out how to manage checkpoints and produce classifications incrementally\r\n- [x] be able to run TM grammars on a web worker in the rich client\r\n- [ ] be able to run TM grammars on a web worker in the web ui\r\n- [ ] move the TS TM grammar on a web worker and send, in batches, tokens.\r\n- [ ] move the TS TM grammar on a web worker and implement greedy viewport tokenization on it.\r\n- [ ] once we have async TM tokens, it is not that big of a leap to have async semantic tokens, so explore pushing tokens from the extension host:\r\n  - [ ] should we write another tokens store that is not line based since these tokens should be more \"rare\"?\r\n  - [ ] how do we manage two tokens stores, one owned by TM, and one owned by the extension host, how do we merge them to give a consistent picture to the editor view?\r\n  - [ ] having TM running in a web worker works because we own both the UI side and the worker side of things, so we know to remember the last N edits, until they get confirmed by the web worker, and the web worker knows which lines to retokenize given it trusts the UI side to update tokens around editing in certain ways. How should we spec this? We need to spec how the editor adjusts tokens when editing and how we expect that the extension host pushes new tokens in the edited areas..."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77138","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77138/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77138/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/77138/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/77138","id":466514712,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NjY1MTQ3MTI=","number":77138,"title":"ability to get/set currently selected debug configuration","user":{"login":"zamanzamanli","id":8949843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NDk4NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/8949843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zamanzamanli","html_url":"https://github.com/zamanzamanli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zamanzamanli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zamanzamanli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zamanzamanli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zamanzamanli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zamanzamanli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zamanzamanli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zamanzamanli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zamanzamanli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zamanzamanli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":290465400,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTA0NjU0MDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/api","name":"api","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":291054922,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTEwNTQ5MjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/debug","name":"debug","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689392,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODkzOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"dcdcdc","default":false},{"id":256129996,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTYxMjk5OTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/help%20wanted","name":"help wanted","color":"fef2c0","default":true}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTgxNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTgxNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2019-07-10T20:52:49Z","updated_at":"2019-10-14T14:14:07Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Currently, we can run `vscode.debug.startDebugging(workspaceFolder, configName)` to run the debugger from the extension.

HockeyApp's responsibilities, but since the [Windows Transition Plan](https://github.com/microsoft/appcenter/blob/specs/specs/2019-04/Windows-Plan.md) indicates that they neither know of Win32 support

design](https://chromium.googlesource.com/crashpad/crashpad/+/HEAD/doc/overview_design.md) (since Electron uses crashpad for Mac), it looks like breakpad protocol is used in all cases.\r\n\r\nYou

Type: <b>Feature Request</b>\r\n\r\nI think that it could be better if \"Toggle Line Comment\" key binding could make a real change in the status of comment on each selected line. For example, if I'm testing two options of a piece of code, I currently have to add comments one block and remove comments on the other (in two steps) to switch between each code version. I would like to mark all the code that will be switched and switch commented lines to not commented and not commented lines to commented ones, with just a keystroke (this is something that I, and perhaps others, use frequently).\r\nI think this will be a better approach, because current function is the same as pressing \"Add/Remove Line Comment\" Key Bindings.\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nVS
