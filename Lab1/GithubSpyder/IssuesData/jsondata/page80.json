we've got this nice surround text with special characters feature that includes `(), [], '', \"\"` and surrounds the selected text with corresponding characters just by pressing `(`, `[`, `'`, `\"` key.\r\n\r\nBut there's no option to surround text with angle brackets that are used in Typescript generics for example. I've searched opened and closed issues, [that's the only one related so far](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1307) but no longer relevant. There's a nice [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mycelo.embrace) that does that, but that's still requires a hotkey combination and not implemented on the editor level. That could be a really nice feature to wrap the selected text with a single `<` key press in the same fashion since Typescript is so tightly integrated into vscode. That could be an opt-in feature if it messes with some other user stories I'm not aware of. Or it wasn't implemented by some other decision?\r\n\r\n![angle-brackets](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15550153/44595690-8029e480-a7d2-11e8-805f-8371f6144fdb.gif)\r\n\r\nAnd there's another feature as `Expand select` that selects within boundaries (same characters again `(), [], '', \"\"`) but doesn't respect angle brackets boundaries. That would be lovely to select text within angle brackets too.\r\n\r\nUsing `Expand select` here, selects within parentheses and braces, ignores angle brackets\r\n\r\n![expand-select](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15550153/44595705-9172f100-a7d2-11e8-9461-ca897681d8ca.gif)\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/57102","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/57102/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/57102/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/57102/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/57102","id":353522637,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNTM1MjI2Mzc=","number":57102,"title":"Jump

In order to start a selection, the cursor must be at least a few pixels into the first character of the line. This can be quite difficult at times. Sometimes I cannot select the first character at all and have tro make the selection right-to-left. Other times it is doable but difficult. No matter what though, a selection cannot begin to the left of the first character (though most editors allow this). And usually not anywhere within the first few pixels of that character.\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.26.1 (493869ee8e8a846b0855873886fc79d480d342de, 2018-08-16T18:38:57.434Z)\r\nOS version:

For example, Atom has a really nice (heck, even animated) updater/installer and you can hide it by clicking off into another window.
