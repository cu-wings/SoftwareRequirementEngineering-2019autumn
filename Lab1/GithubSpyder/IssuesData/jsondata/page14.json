Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->\r\nHI! I care a lot for 50/72 commit message rule and I depend a lot on VSCode's source control's commit message input.\r\nThe problem is that I always start to write, and I wait for the warning to appear, then if I'm in title, (first line), I try to change what I intended to say to contain only 50 chars; and if I'm in description (lines after the break after the first line) I write as much as I get the warning, and then I go back to before the current word and insert a new line there (press enter). This pattern is becoming so annoying. I want to observe how much I'm writing on the current line.

For some features, the provider's 'score' is used to select which provider to use (e.g. for formatting and syntax highlighting). For other features, results from all providers are merged (e.g. completion, hover, definition, problems, symbols).\r\n\r\nMy problem is that in some cases I would like to choose which features to use from which extension. For example, I have three extensions that provide overlapping language features for Python: Microsoft's Python, pyright, and mypy extensions. \r\n * For hovers, I only like the ones provided by the Python extension (it supports showing documentation while the others don't). Seeing hovers from all three extensions is distracting.\r\n * For error reporting, I would like to see only the ones from mypy. It is possible to filter the problems view, but it's annoying to filter every time, and filtering just for 'mypy' will ignore errors from other languages I have in my workspace. Without filtering, many duplicate errors are shown.\r\n * For 'go to definition' and code completion, I would like to use only pyright. By default, results from all three extensions are shown – this requires multiple clicks for every 'go to definition' call because results slightly differ between extensions, so they are shown side by side instead of immediately jumping to the definition.\r\n\r\nOne solution is to ask every extension author to provide options for disabling some features. This is already done by some extensions but AFAIK not by most. It can be solved centrally by allowing users to selectively disable language features provided by extensions. Something similar has [already been implemented](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/41882) for formatting, using a dedicated setting. I think it should be extended to other language features. \r\n\r\nSomething like:\r\n```json\r\n\"languageFeatures.[extension].goToDefinition.enabled\": false\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default all features from all extensions would be enabled."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/80881","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/80881/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/80881/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/80881/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/80881","id":493412033,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0OTM0MTIwMzM=","number":80881,"title":"Autosave
