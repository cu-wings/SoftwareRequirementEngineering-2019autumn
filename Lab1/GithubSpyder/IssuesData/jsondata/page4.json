See https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/61516, specifically the comments.\r\n\r\n> No, it is an upstream [vscode] issue. We [arch linux] are sane people so we don't distribute a full copy of electron with VS Code, we use the electron already present on your system. This is the exact same reason why we use dynamic libraries instead of statically linking everything. It is on the upstream for not supporting this properly, I already took the appropriate actions to try get them to look into this but they don't seem interested. I can't do anything other that hope someone looks into this.\r\n\r\nThe bugfix of #70403 would be really appreciated - it's troublesome not being able to use the `save file as sudo`

have found out in https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/82203 that most other SCM providers break the tree rendering. This happens because they provide folders as resources themselves, which simply breaks the tree.\r\n\r\nThis should actually just be supported, but we need to address what happens to the contextual menus. With the tree rendering addition, folders have their own context key for menus. Currently in these SCM providers, the folders have the same actions as the files and maybe that's intended, so we should preserve that.\r\n\r\nI suggest the following:\r\n\r\n1. If a folder is provided as a resource, simply use the regular resource context key, thus maintaining the current behavior. Also, we need to change the _should expand on twistie click only_ behavior, since those resources might have a command to run when clicked.\r\n2. Else, populate the menu using the new folder context key.\r\n3.

Click on Debug --> \"Add Configuration...\"\r\nerror message \"Cannot read property 'openConfigFile' of undefined\" appears.\r\n\r\nWorkaround is: Debug --> \"Open Configurations\" --> C++(GDB/LLDB)\r\n--> launch.json is created\r\n\r\nRemoving launch.json again and then clicking on \"Add Configuration...\" works. \r\n\r\nSo, it doesn't work at the first time using \"Add
