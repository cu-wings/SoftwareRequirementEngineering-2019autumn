Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nI wrote this small script to use `cluster` to launch some subprocesses:\r\n\r\n**index.js**\r\n```js\r\nconst cluster = require('cluster');\r\n\r\nif (cluster.isMaster) {\r\n    console.log(`Master ${process.pid} is running`);\r\n\r\n    // Fork 4 workers.\r\n    for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\r\n        const WORKER_NUM = i;\r\n        cluster.fork({\r\n            WORKER_NUM\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    cluster.on('exit', (worker, code, signal) => {\r\n        console.log(`worker ${worker.process.pid} died`);\r\n    });\r\n} else {\r\n    console.log(`Worker ${process.pid} started ${process.env.WORKER_NUM}`);\r\n\r\n    // Add a breakpoint on only the 3rd worker\r\n    if (process.env.WORKER_NUM === '3') {\r\n        console.log(\"I am worker 3!\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is my `launch.json` file:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\r\n    \"configurations\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"type\": \"node\",\r\n

}\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I hit the \"play\" button on that config it looks like the subprocesses never run:\r\n```\r\n$ cd /tmp/tmp.Y3yEbU3KdQ ; /usr/local/google/home/samstern/.nvm/versions/node/v10.16.0/bin/node --inspect-brk=40242 index.js \r\nDebugger listening on ws://127.0.0.1:40242/b3cb7ac5-3710-42f9-b1be-9d9ca4fb4560\r\nFor help, see:

index.js\r\nMaster 236586 is running\r\nWorker 236595 started 1\r\nWorker 236594 started 0\r\nWorker 236596 started 2\r\nWorker 236598 started 3\r\nI am worker 3!\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it looks like the subprocesses are getting `--inspect-brk` but the debugger is never attaching (and giving a continue signal) so they can't actually get to my code.\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.39.1
