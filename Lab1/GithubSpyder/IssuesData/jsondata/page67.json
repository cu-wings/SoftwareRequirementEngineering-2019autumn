Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nOn graphical Ubuntu Linux the windowing option in the control menu there is an option for: \"Always On Visible Workspace\" (being an Desktop workspace, not a VSCode workspace).  That means my vscode window is visible in every ddesktop.\r\n\r\nSelecting that option works for a little while, say 30 min or so.  It always seems to be reset or cleared.  When it does reset; the VSCode window can vanish from the current desktop and is only to be found on the desktop it thinks of a 'home'(??).\r\n\r\nIt is very annoying and irksome when the editor you rely on  just vanishes like that.  I used to think that code had crashed.  Not so.\r\n\r\nIn contrast many other windows have \"Always on Visible Workspace\" file browser, terminal, some browswer windows.  These work as expected.  And from memory when I used Atom, it was also well behaved.\r\n\r\nHow is  VSCode dropping the ball?\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.29.1 (bc24f98b5f70467bc689abf41cc5550ca637088e,
