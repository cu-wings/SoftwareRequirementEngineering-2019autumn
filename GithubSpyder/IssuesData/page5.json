check if a given character is an EOL character, which compares a given character to `\\r` and  `\\n`. While it works on macOS, I've not yet been able to test this in other operating systems and I'd much rather use an already tested and trusted implementation, but I couldn't find it in the existing codebase.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/d58af3cb013fd7678587e62e41c0b8b05225b11e/src/vs/base/browser/ui/inputbox/inputBox.ts#L570-L572\r\n\r\n- As you can see in the linked video, I had to make a few visual design choices (positioning, padding, fixed width, etc.). If you disagree with any of my decisions or if there is anything else that I can do to improve this implementation please let me know, as this is my first time implementing something more than a simple bug fix in vscode.

Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen a new document.\r\nSet language mode to JSON.\r\nProvide the following content...\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-03/schema\",\r\n  \"type\":\"array\",\r\n  \"items\": {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`items` is incorrectly highlighted as invalid because it's an object.\r\nThis is incorrect, but is likely because the meta-schema is being parsed not as a draft-3 schema.\r\n\r\nIn draft-3, `type` would accept schemas as well as primitive types as strings.\r\nThis was removed in draft-4.\r\n\r\nGiven that it's not expected many people use draft-3, it may be preferable to not support draft-3 at all, and in stead indicate that draft-3 is not supported.\r\n\r\nThis case can be identified when loading a schema for a JSON document, and detecting that both `$schema` and `id` (not `$id` for draft-3) are `\"http://json-schema.org/draft-03/schema#\"`\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes\r\n\r\n\r\nFYI: I'm one of the core team on the JSON Schema spec

Darwin x64 18.7.0\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. open a powershell file with the PowerShell e x tension\r\n2. drop a breakpoint and F5\r\n3. Hit the restart button when the breakpoint is hit\r\n\r\nYou'll notice nothing happens... this is because `resolveDebugConfiguration` is not run for when the debug adapter is starting up again so it can't set up needed state on the client side.\r\n\r\nThe 'restart' command isn't supported so this is behavior should be shutting down and starting up the debug adapter again.\r\n\r\nIs this by design that it's not running `resolveDebugConfiguration` on restart? If so, any recs on how we can set up state in the extension host side before the debug adapter is launched?"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81802","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81802/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81802/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81802/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/81802","id":501164743,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MDExNjQ3NDM=","number":81802,"title":"Image
