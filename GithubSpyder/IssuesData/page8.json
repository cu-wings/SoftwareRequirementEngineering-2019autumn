my previous PR #79651 by implementing [recommendations](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/78894#issuecomment-535254539) from @octref on #78894 .\r\n\r\nFurther to #70693 which was reworked by @aeschli  in https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/commit/8f7293470661319099bdda43eecc386a43c87189 due to issues with require.resolve and webpack.\r\n\r\n- Fixes #78894\r\n- Fixes microsoft/vscode-css-languageservice#136\r\n\r\nThe current implementation for microsoft/vscode-css-languageservice#136 resolves the path to a CSS module but only looks for node_modules in the same folder as the CSS file, which for many use cases is not sufficient.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates `resolvePathToModule` so that it looks in parent folders for the existence of `node_modules/module-name` all the way up to the workspace root, following node module resolution.\r\n\r\nAlternative approaches were raised in #79651 and this approach was preferred by @octref in https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/78894#issuecomment-535254539.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2019-08-23 at 16 18

Any advice?\n\n---\n\n@karrtikr commented on [Thu Sep 26 2019](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/issues/7591#issuecomment-535717671)\n\nFor changing keybindings, go to `File` -> `Preferences` -> `Keyboard shortcuts`. Search for `Go to definition`.\r\nAnyways, this is controlled by VSCode, not the extension. So I am transferring the issue.\n\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81518","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81518/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81518/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81518/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/81518","id":499148206,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0OTkxNDgyMDY=","number":81518,"title":"100% Reproducible Crash on [CMD + o, escape] to exit the open dialog.","user":{"login":"ronyeh","id":239113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzOTExMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/239113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronyeh","html_url":"https://github.com/ronyeh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronyeh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronyeh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronyeh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronyeh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronyeh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronyeh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronyeh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronyeh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronyeh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":556079247,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NTYwNzkyNDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/electron","name":"electron","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":293389403,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTMzODk0MDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/freeze-slow-crash","name":"freeze-slow-crash","color":"eb6420","default":false},{"id":286886536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyODY4ODY1MzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/upstream","name":"upstream","color":"dcdcdc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"deepak1556","id":964386,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NDM4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/964386?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556","html_url":"https://github.com/deepak1556","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"deepak1556","id":964386,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NDM4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/964386?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556","html_url":"https://github.com/deepak1556","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepak1556/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2019-09-26T22:39:21Z","updated_at":"2019-09-27T09:26:54Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Issue Type: **BUG**\r\n\r\nI open a folder from Terminal on macOS.\r\n\r\n`code .`\r\n\r\nThen I immediately hit `CMD + o` to launch the open dialog.\r\n\r\nThen I hit `esc`.\r\n\r\nCrash. 100% of the time.\r\n\r\nI'm on macOS 10.14.3 and have installed the most recent VSCode.

I've tested the following cases so far:\r\n\r\n- MacOS, newest TS with VS Code Stable — ✅ works\r\n- MacOS, stable TS with VS Code Stable — ✅ works\r\n- MacOS, stable TS with VS Code insides — ❌ broken\r\n- MacOS, newest TS with VS Code insides — ❌ broken\r\n- MacOS, TS 3.3 (an old version) with VS Code insiders — ❌ broken\r\n- Windows, any TS with VS Code Insiders — ✅ works\r\n\r\nBehind the scenes, TS uses node's `fs.watch` by default so I suspect the bug is somewhere with that not firing events properly\r\n\r\nAs @RyanCavanaugh and @sheetalkamat brought up, we cannot fix this on the TS side old TS versions are also broken"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81510","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81510/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81510/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81510/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/81510","id":499052960,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0OTkwNTI5NjA=","number":81510,"title":"Terminal

Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nThe search indexer (ripgrep?) seems to index the entire project before performing a search even if the \"files to include\" option excludes 99% of the file tree. After indexing is complete, search results are nearly instant, but the index seems to be invalidated at least a couple times a day (I'm not sure what the mechanism is).\r\n\r\nOur codebase at work contains at least 10k files, and performing a global search on it literally slows my mouse down if the index has to be rebuilt.\r\n\r\nWould it be feasible/faster to glob the \"files to include\" option first, build a list of files to search, then search only those files?\r\n\r\nIf not, is there something I can do to prevent the index from being invalidated so often?\r\n\r\nVS Code version:
