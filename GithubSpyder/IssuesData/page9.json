`DebugConfigurationProvider` may resolve a configuration that includes a `preLaunchTask`.  This task will be executed after resolution (obviously) but executed before the debugging session starts.\r\n\r\nThere are several scenarios (e.g. in the case of Docker debugging) where details of the debugging session (e.g. the port to which the debugger should attach) may ultimately depend on that pre-launch task (e.g. mapping a given container port to a host port).  However, because the debug configuration is resolved *before* the task executes, it requires upfront agreement between the task configuration and the debug configuration and precludes the debug configuration being derived from the *result* of the pre-launch task.  E.g. the user must explicitly choose a port for both to use rather than the pre-launch task determine an available port and have debug configuration use that available port.\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful if a `DebugConfigurationProvider` had a means of deferring resolution of certain properties of its configuration until *after* the pre-launch task (if any) has executed.  The `DebugConfigurationProvider` could then use the results of that execution to alter its previously resolved configuration (if necessary).\r\n\r\nAn, initial, likely naive API might look like:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\ninterface DebugConfigurationProvider {\r\n    // Existing API:\r\n    provideDebugConfigurations(folder: WorkspaceFolder | undefined, token?: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<DebugConfiguration[]>;\r\n    resolveDebugConfiguration(folder: WorkspaceFolder | undefined, debugConfiguration: DebugConfiguration, token?: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<DebugConfiguration | undefined>;\r\n\r\n    // Proposed API:\r\n    // Called after the preLaunchTask successfully executes but before debugging starts and includes the executed pre-launch task object (presumably used to derive any necessary changes).\r\n    resolveDebugConfigurationPostLaunchTask?(folder: WorkspaceFolder | undefined, debugConfiguration: DebugConfiguration, preLaunchTask: Task, token?: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<DebugConfiguration | undefined>\r\n}\r\n```"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81436","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81436/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81436/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81436/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/81436","id":498468408,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0OTg0Njg0MDg=","number":81436,"title":"Insiders

pattern when dealing with bidirectional channel is:\r\n```\r\nchannel.onSomeEvent(event => handleEvent(event));\r\n...\r\nconst response = await channel.sendCommand(params);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we consider the other side of the cannel, it often sends events in between request and response:\r\n```\r\nhandleSomeCommand(args): {\r\n  ...\r\n  this.sendSomeEvent(params);\r\n  ...\r\n  return result;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis generates the following sequence of messages: `[someEvent, someCommandResponse]`, which is handled by the channel in the order of `someEvent, someCommandResponse`.\r\n\r\nHowever, `someEvent` is then dispatched synchronously (see `onSomeEvent` above), while `someCommandResponse` is handled through a promise (see `await sendCommand` above). More general, various event handlers and command response handlers contain arbitrary promise chains of different lengths before being handled. This turns commands/events which did arrive in the right order during a single `javascript task` - into handlers which run in absolutely different order due to different chains of `javascript microtasks`.\r\n\r\nTo guarantee the order of processing between various events and command responses, we can artificially insert `javascript task` boundaries between them. This ensures that any `javascript microtasks` related to the first event/response handling will finish before the next event/response is processed, no matter how long the promise chain was, thanks to the javascript tasks spec.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81399","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81399/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81399/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81399/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/81399","id":497945079,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0OTc5NDUwNzk=","number":81399,"title":"On non-Windows, the debug command line expects a `sh` compliant shell","user":{"login":"SteveL-MSFT","id":11859881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODU5ODgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/11859881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveL-MSFT","html_url":"https://github.com/SteveL-MSFT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveL-MSFT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveL-MSFT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveL-MSFT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveL-MSFT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveL-MSFT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveL-MSFT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveL-MSFT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveL-MSFT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveL-MSFT/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTgxNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTgxNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2019-09-24T21:59:43Z","updated_at":"2019-10-02T03:32:17Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.38.1\r\n- OS Version: macOS 18.7.0\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

This generally works well but can cause issues with Git functionality in other tools. We use VS Code for development and it's a pain to not have the integrated diff functionality when reviewing changes of encrypted files.\r\n\r\n**Current Situation**\r\n\r\nThe `.gitattributes` file is modified to add the necessary [filter](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes) attribute (amongst others) so git works as expected when checking out, merging etc. Lots of other tools will set attributes as well.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the basic git commands will work in VS Code but not the diff functionality due to the way the extension uses git show to obtain the file content which bypasses any settings in `.gitattributes`. \r\n\r\nCurrently a user will receive the following message:\r\n\r\n> The file is not displayed in the editor because it is either binary or uses an unsupported text encoding\r\n\r\nAlthough our use case is for git-crypt specifically, this issue affects any tool that relies on `.gitattributes` being properly supported. We have focused on the `filter` attribute only as this is the only attribute we have discovered a need to support at present.\r\n\r\n**Overall Approach**\r\n\r\nAll changes occur in the git extension (`extensions/git`)\r\n\r\n1. *No breaking API changes*. All changes are accomplished via addition of optional parameters so existing functionality will be unaffected. The external extension API interface in `src/api/api1.ts` has deliberately not been modified at present. Once the implementation has been validated and tested then consideration should be given to whether this should be updated. \r\n\r\n2. Support has been added to call [git check-attr](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-check-attr) to check relevant file paths for a `filter` attribute. This is exposed via `getGitFilter`.\r\n\r\n3. Git URIs have been modified to support an extra `filter` parameter to indicate if a filter is required to be used to obtain the content of a git object. \r\n\r\n4. `getURI` in `commands.ts` has been modified to check the filter defined (if any) for a given path. If a filter is set, this is passed to `detectObjectType` so it can detect the correct encoding of the content by passing through filter. It is also added to the URI.\r\n\r\n5. The `show` in `repository.ts` now takes the optional filter parameter (as provided by URI). This will be cause content to be piped through the filter prior to being returned.\r\n\r\n**Some Future Considerations**\r\n\r\n1. Would it ever be worthwhile to add a configuration option to skip filter checking in `getURI`?\r\n2. May require further improvements to check for the filter attributes using `.gitattributes` as per the relevant Git reference instead of `HEAD`. However, current functionality is very useful and support for this use case can be added later.\r\n3. Requires use of `shell` option when spawning child process for `git show` so output can be piped to filter (which is in an unknown location). Although there is a possibly security risk here this is arguably not any greater than the user using relevant git commands which will in essence perform the same activity. However, need to ensure this works on all supported platforms and confirm this

Problem\r\nRemote extensions current each implement their own version of port forwarding, including their own configuration and UI related to port forwarding (see the ssh and containers extensions for example). Even with just two extensions supporting port forwarding, the UX around port forwarding is not consistent and we have duplicated development effort. This problem will  become worse as more extensions / scenarios add support for port forwarding\r\n\r\nAdditionally, VS Code has a built-in tunneling mechanism that can be used to implement a limited version of port forwarding even if the remote extension doesn't directly support it. There is currently no UI for managing these tunnels. Managing these will become important if we allow extensions to open new tunnels, as #81131 proposes\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\nBuild a unified port forwarding user experience that the remote extensions can contribute to. This would act somewhat like the existing `Remote Explorer` contribution\r\n\r\n**High level UX Needs**\r\n- List ports currently being forwarded\r\n    - Include human readable names\r\n    - Maybe include type (through VS Code's built-in tunnel service, through remote, external, ...)\r\n- Let user close one of these ports\r\n- Let user open a new port forwarding\r\n\r\n**High level extension API needs**\r\n- A way for VS Code to call out to the remote extension to create a new port forwarding. We also need to be able to tear down this connection (probably just make the result of the api call disposable)\r\n- A way for a remote extension to tell us about port forwardings managed outside of VS Code (see [ssh's `LocalFoward` support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh#_always-forwarding-a-port) for an example of this)\r\n    - We likely also need a way so that the extension can signal that its external port forwardings have changed\r\n- Possible: provide a list of candidate ports for forwarding but that require user action to establish? (see the [containers port forwarding ux](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_temporarily-forwarding-a-port) for an example of this)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n/cc @Chuxel for general

The amount of space is so small, it's difficult to get to the first position.

this example, if svn source control provider is initialized first then quick diff are only displayed for modified svn files. Inversely, if git source control provider is initialized first then quick diff is displayed only for git modified files.\r\n\r\nIn this example I take 2 repositories for both scm to show that if you have git repositories only or svn repositories only, you will not have the issue.\r\n\r\nHope explanations are clear, otherwise feel free to ask me details on this issue.\r\n\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nVS

order to properly separate methods that can only be used from `electron-browser` and not `browser`, we need to move them to a place that is only accessible by `electron-browser`.\r\n\r\nCurrently a lot of window related methods are used within `titlebarPart.ts` for the custom title (e.g. minimize/maximize). We know already that the custom title will not be present in the web.\r\n\r\nPlease find a way to move the custom title into `src/vs/workbench/electron-browser`.
