An issue I ran into is VSCode's attempt at opening the last open files / windows in the last session when launching the app. I don't have the exact same files on both machines, and would actually just prefer that VSCode portable would distinguish between the two machines and save a set of open windows / files on for each machine.\r\n\r\nAs a result, when I open VSCode on machine 1, it attempts to open some files that are not present on that machine, which in turn makes VSCode not attempt to open those files when launching on machine 2, which do have the files.\r\n\r\nAlternatively I have to maintain two portable versions of VSCode: VSCode-iMac and VSCode-MacbookPro. Currently this is the only feasible option if I want to use portable, but it doubles the disk space usage. Duplicating the app is particularly cumbersome with VSCode because it's a an app that has ~10^4-10^5 files, many more than a typical app. Most of the files are very small, yes, but the sheer amount of files being changed frequently makes VSCode Portable very sync-heavy. All of this is to say, I'd prefer not to have two copies of VSCode for that reason, but I'd still prefer to use portable mode for other reasons (e.g. no need to install on fresh systems + ability to use on system without admin access).\r\n\r\nThe best would be the ability to group machines together \"these two machines are work, these two are personal\", allowing the use of one single portable installation for many machines, some sharing the same purpose and set of available projects/files, but otherwise sharing the same extensions and setup by virtue of being one portable installation."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81337","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81337/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81337/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81337/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/81337","id":497361026,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0OTczNjEwMjY=","number":81337,"title":"Insert Line After KeyBinding cannot be overridden","user":{"login":"VohuMana","id":7939816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5Mzk4MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7939816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VohuMana","html_url":"https://github.com/VohuMana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VohuMana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VohuMana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VohuMana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VohuMana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VohuMana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VohuMana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VohuMana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VohuMana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VohuMana/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":398766855,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzOTg3NjY4NTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-find","name":"editor-find","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":297959291,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc5NTkyOTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/keybindings","name":"keybindings","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjkyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjkyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2019-09-23T22:33:05Z","updated_at":"2019-10-01T12:49:17Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\nIssue Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\n**Issue**:\r\nIn VSCode version 1.38.1 when I tried to find and replace all in a file using \"Ctrl+Enter\" a message popped up saying \"Ctrl+Enter now inserts line break instead of replacing all.

Create a .NET Core console app with [UseConsoleLifetime](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.hosting.hostinghostbuilderextensions.useconsolelifetime) ...\r\n\r\n   ```csharp\r\n   public class Program\r\n   {\r\n       public static async Task Main(string[] args)\r\n       {\r\n           using (var host = Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)\r\n               .UseConsoleLifetime()\r\n               .Build())\r\n           {\r\n               // Start the host\r\n               await host.StartAsync();\r\n   \r\n               // Wait for the host to shutdown\r\n               await host.WaitForShutdownAsync();\r\n           }\r\n       }\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   The preceding code works if the app is run with `dotnet run` in a command shell ...\r\n\r\n   <img width=\"503\" alt=\"Capture1\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1622880/65440864-027a4300-ddef-11e9-8b9a-c9a1d8033818.PNG\">\r\n\r\n2. Use a console debugger profile and run the same app in the `externalTerminal` ...\r\n\r\n   ```json\r\n   {\r\n      \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\r\n      \"configurations\": [\r\n          {\r\n              \"name\": \".NET Core Launch (console)\",\r\n              \"type\": \"coreclr\",\r\n              \"request\": \"launch\",\r\n              \"preLaunchTask\": \"build\",\r\n              \"program\": \"${workspaceFolder}/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.0/ConsoleSample.dll\",\r\n              \"args\": [],\r\n              \"cwd\": \"${workspaceFolder}\",\r\n              \"stopAtEntry\": false,\r\n              \"console\": \"externalTerminal\"\r\n          }\r\n       ]\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   The app will not respond to `Ctrl+C`. In prior versions (.NET Core 2.2), `Ctrl+C` would work when using the `externalTerminal` in this scenario.\r\n\r\nI asked ASP.NET Core engineering, and they thought it might be on the VSC-side of the equation given that `Ctrl+C` works when the app is run in a command shell. See item response **4** at https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore.Docs/issues/12841#issuecomment-533206352.\r\n\r\nI put up a repro project at https://github.com/guardrex/ConsoleSample.\r\n\r\nThe sample app that I put up also has a keystroke-monitoring service that logs presses of the `w` key. That code works. Running in the `externalTerminal`, the app reports that it hears the `w` key clicks, while the app doesn't respond to `Ctrl+C`. Sure, the app could listen for `Ctrl+C` there and shut the app down, but that's not the point ... that would be a hack. `UseConsoleLifetime` should work the way that this app works in a normal command shell (*I think* :smile:).\r\n\r\n**Does this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?** That can't be checked because the configured debug type is `coreclr`, which isn't supported without either (or both) C# OmniSharp. In fact, I'm not sure if this bug report should be filed here or over on https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81320","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81320/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81320/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81320/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/81320","id":497155227,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0OTcxNTUyMjc=","number":81320,"title":"Bug:

I recently changed the font for the whole OS from `font-1` to `font-2`. With this, the font of text in `settings`, `side-bar`, `menu`, `status-bar`, etc. of VSCODE also changed.

I tried several things --- (i) changed the OS font to `font-4`, (ii) reinstalled VSCODE. None of these changed the font of VSCODE.

people have brought up instances where `explorer.autoReveal`, when activated, causes an undesirable change to the sidebar. It would be nice if there were a richer way to configure this option.\r\n\r\nFor me, the main complaint with autoReveal is when i ctrl-click on a type in a TypeScript project, which jumps me deep into node_modules where the `.d.ts` file is. i'll usually look through that file, close it, and go back to what i was coding. However, because of autoReveal, i now have node_modules expanded, which on large projects completely overwhelms my sidebar. I'd like to have a way to either explicitly add paths to ignore, or have a way to use say, .gitignore's paths (i know they're evaluated in some fashion since they're de-emphasized visually in the sidebar).\r\n\r\nI'm aware that there's a way to hover/display a pop-up of a definition, but more often than not, i'll just use the default 'go to' since its the easiest, and in many cases i do need to see more context from that overall typing definition file.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81231","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81231/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81231/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81231/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/81231","id":496368237,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0OTYzNjgyMzc=","number":81231,"title":"Terminal window doesn't open at startup","user":{"login":"andyj513","id":7398218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczOTgyMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7398218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyj513","html_url":"https://github.com/andyj513","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyj513/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyj513/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyj513/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyj513/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyj513/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyj513/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyj513/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyj513/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyj513/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129993,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTYxMjk5OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"8D6673","default":true},{"id":256129996,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTYxMjk5OTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/help%20wanted","name":"help wanted","color":"fef2c0","default":true},{"id":362694632,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNjI2OTQ2MzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/integrated-terminal","name":"integrated-terminal","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTMzMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTMzMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2019-09-20T13:57:27Z","updated_at":"2019-09-25T19:57:04Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\nIssue Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nI changed my Terminal->Integrated: Cwd setting to \"$(workspaceFolder)\".

This happens every time I launch Code.\r\n\r\nHowever, once Code has loaded, I can then do Ctrl-` to open a Terminal window, and it works as expected (also every time).  Note that this is doing Remote development (so the Terminal is opening a session on my remote machine).\r\n\r\nI suspect the issue is that Code is trying to start the Terminal before $workspaceFolder is set, but it is set later, when I manually open the Terminal.
