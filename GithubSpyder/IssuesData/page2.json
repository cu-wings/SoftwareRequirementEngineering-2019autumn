Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\n1.

F5 to debug and create a `.yaml` file to activate the extension. Exit the debugger\r\n5. This should all be fine so far\r\n6. In `extension.ts`, after line 133, add the following line: `console.log('***** hello');`.  DO NOT SAVE THE FILE!\r\n7. Press F5 to debug.  Expected: I should see `***** hello` in the debug console.  Actual: I don't see the new message\r\n8. Exit the debugger.  Edit the line to read `console.log('***** goodbye');`\r\n9. Save the file and IMMEDIATELY hit F5.  Expected: I should see `***** goodbye` in the debug console.  Actual: I now see `***** hello` from the previous build which was the last one to complete.\r\n10. If you edit the message again and save the file _then wait for a slow count of 3 before debugging_, then you _do_ pick up the update\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.38.1

Install the C/C++ extension.\r\n\r\nBug: Errors occur in the Toggle Developer Console window due to the fact that C_Cpp.commentContinationPatterns default value of [ \"/**\" ] isn't being used. The bug doesn't repro in the non-Insiders VS Code or after reloading the window. We can workaround this bug via checking for the undefined value and manually setting the default (but the root issue could cause other extensions to fail).\r\n\r\nOur package.json is at \r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cpptools/blob/release/Extension/package.json\r\n\r\nActivating extension 'ms-vscode.cpptools' failed: Cannot read property 'forEach' of undefined.\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes/No\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/82068","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/82068/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/82068/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/82068/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/82068","id":503727435,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MDM3Mjc0MzU=","number":82068,"title":"fails

Open a JavaScript project with JavaScript dependencies.\r\n2. Find a function in the project that is defined in one of the dependencies.\r\n3. Use \"Go to Definition\" to drill down and find out how that function is implemented.\r\n4. Sometimes you find what you are looking for: the source of the function.  However, sometimes you find a file named something like `index.d.ts` that is definitely not what you were looking for.\r\n\r\nI made two movies of the steps above.  In both movies, I'm drilling down three levels: from [`useMachine`](https://github.com/matthewp/robot-hooks/blob/cec670b1a1f2d7a54ec594bbec2646ae6d4a51af/test/test.js#L40) to [`createUseMachine`](https://github.com/matthewp/robot-hooks/blob/cec670b1a1f2d7a54ec594bbec2646ae6d4a51af/machine.js#L15-L41) to [`interpret`](https://github.com/matthewp/robot/blob/869d170e3780b8a4d198b4fe5519303006d9c3d6/machine.js#L174-L183).  In the first movie, I succeed in finding the implementation of `interpret`.  In the second movie, I fail.\r\n\r\nHere is the first movie (success):\r\n\r\n![success](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41094/66328014-117dec80-e8e9-11e9-9b43-425c1338bb32.gif)\r\n\r\nHere is the second movie (failure):\r\n![failure](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41094/66328081-32464200-e8e9-11e9-9db0-999db0f3feca.gif)\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes\r\n\r\nThe behavior I describe above **feels** like a bug to me.  I imagine people who author their projects in TypeScript might call it a feature.  But maybe they would admit that the inconsistency (sometimes jumping to a `*.js` file and sometimes jumping to a `*.d.ts` file) is unsettling at least.  Whether it is a feature or a bug, I'm left with these two questions (which I know are meant for StackOverflow instead of this issue tracker):\r\n\r\n1. As a JavaScript application developer, is it possible to configure VSCode to prefer the JavaScript sources over `*.d.ts` files in \"Go to Definition?\"\r\n\r\n2. As a JavaScript library developer, is there anything I can do when publishing my library to make it so users can more easily get to the JavaScript sources and don't accidentally end up jumping to a `*.d.ts` file?\r\n\r\nThis \"Go to Definition\" functionality, IntelliSense more broadly, and all of VSCode are incredible.  Thank you so much for your work on them.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/82051","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/82051/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/82051/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/82051/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/82051","id":503488453,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MDM0ODg0NTM=","number":82051,"title":"When

October we groom our open issues.\r\n\r\n## Preparation\r\n- [ ] review [issue types](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Issue-Tracking#issue-types)\r\n- [ ] review [feature areas](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Feature-Areas)\r\n- [ ] review [issue grooming](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Issue-Grooming)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Review Guidelines\r\n\r\nIn the first pass reviewing the issues has a higher priority than fixing issues. Clearly, we'll use common sense, i.e. we'll make easy fixes on the fly. During review please make sure:\r\n\r\n- to close obsolete/fixed issues and mark duplicates as appropriate,\r\n- that each issue has a [type](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Issue-Tracking#issue-types) \r\n- that each issue is assigned to a [feature area](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Feature-Areas)\r\n- that bugs that you plan to fix during October are assigned to the October milestone. Since the main focus is on housekeeping, be conservative.\r\n- to close out-of-scope feature requests assign the `*out-of-scope` label. Take into account that we'll have a \"polishing, take care of smaller issues\" milestone in early 2020. There is no value in keeping issues open that don't have any realistic chance of being addressed.\r\n- close bugs as \"won't fix\" if there is no cost-benefit balance. It's not that we don't care about users who are affected by an issue but, for example, if the fix is so involved that we risk regressions for many, fixing is not a reasonable choice.\r\n\r\nOtherwise the normal rules apply:\r\n- assign the `important` label to issues that\r\n  -  result in data loss\r\n  - a breakage of extension\r\n  - critical security, performance issues\r\n  - UI issue that makes a feature unusable\r\n- issues that the community can take up should be labeled as `help-wanted`\r\n- if issues are suitable for beginners you can also add the `good-first-issue` label and add code pointers that help beginners to get started with a PR\r\n- feature requests that should be implemented as extensions should be labeled `extensions-candidate` and be closed\r\n\r\n\r\n## Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease make sure that you also do this grooming in our satellite repositories.\r\n\r\n### Issues assigned to you\r\n- [ ] @aeschli \r\n- [ ] @alexandrudima\r\n- [ ] @bowdenk7\r\n- [ ]

to Definition and Find All Reference are not 100% reliable in VsCode. The problem occur with VsCode itself for the langages it handle and with extensions for the others langages. VsCode (or the extensions) sometimes doesn't find any definition, or sometimes they don't find all references. That happen because the way of finding the definition and references is based on a certain level of \"understanding\" of the code. So when the code do something that make it hard to find definition and references you end up with something broken. \r\n\r\nI don't have any exemple for a language that VsCode handle but that not hard to find. I have one with Prestashop 1.6.1 source code with the extension Intelephense. If you try to go to definition of $product->addCombinationEntity in controllers/admin/AdminImportController.php it doesn't find any definition and if you try to find all references of $product->addCombinationEntity it doesn't find anything. It fail besause the way that Prestashop name and load Class (https://github.com/bmewburn/vscode-intelephense/issues/700).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand Go to definition and Find all references work 100% of the time in Sublime text and a lot of developers would love to have something similar in VsCode. It seem that Sublime just make a text search to show definition and reference. It's very basic since it show you everything it find even in other langage (ex: js whereas you are in a php file...) but it find everything and it's very reliable. If we can have the same thing in VsCode maybe even better if you limit the search to relevant code (same langage) it will be awesome. Maybe as a workspace option to activate only on project that need it.\r\n\r\nText search is far from perfect but it's far far better than having nothing or, worse, missing references for example when you need to modify all of them. I think a lot of developers rely on Go to definition and Find all reference to quickly navigate through code. A lot of developers use Sublime and love it whereas it have only a very basic text search based Go to definition and Find all reference but that work 100% of the time. Again, an optional text search in complement will make VsCode on par with Sublime for these features, and even better if you manage to limit the result to relevant code, and will fulfill the need of a lot of developers.\r\n\r\nWe need these features to be 100% reliable to use them professionally so, in my opinion, it's almost mandatory to include an optional text search in Go to definition and Find all references. Thanks !\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/82021","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/82021/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/82021/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/82021/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/82021","id":503074747,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MDMwNzQ3NDc=","number":82021,"title":"Markdown image links with relative paths that navigate back - not displayed in Markdown Preview","user":{"login":"alexbarten","id":7818752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTg3NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7818752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbarten","html_url":"https://github.com/alexbarten","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbarten/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbarten/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbarten/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbarten/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbarten/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbarten/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbarten/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbarten/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbarten/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":299344519,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTkzNDQ1MTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/markdown","name":"markdown","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODIxOTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODIxOTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2019-10-06T09:22:42Z","updated_at":"2019-10-07T20:42:57Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.39.0-insider and 1.38.1-stable\r\n- The insider version has no extensions installed\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10 Pro 1903\r\n- Does this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes\r\n\r\nMarkdown image links with relative paths that navigate up **`(..\\)`** are not displayed in the Markdown Preview.

Create/copy an image in a different folder on the same level (adjacent) or higher in the folder hierarchy.  \r\nFor example: the .md in: C:\\Users\\you\\learning\\summaries \r\nand the image in C:\\Users\\you\\learning\\resources or n C:\\Users\\you\\learning\r\n3.

No difference.\r\n2. I have used adjacent (= same level), child and parent folders. This is how I found out that child folders do not pose a problem, whereas parent and adjacent folders do. So when I use `..\\` in the path the problem occurs, else not.\r\n3. I have used forward and backward slashes in the path description. No difference.\r\n4.
