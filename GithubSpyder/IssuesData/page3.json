is a **command called \"cursorUndo\"**, which undo's cursor and selection movements.\r\nIn the command palette it is called \"Soft Undo\".\r\n\r\nI think the **name in the command palette should be changed from \"Soft Undo\" to \"Cursor Undo\"**.\r\n\r\n#### Motivation:\r\n\r\nThis will make the command more discoverable, and more intuitive for users to figure out what it does.\r\n\r\nWhen I found this command in the command palette, I tried typing \"hello\" and then using it, but it did nothing, because the cursor hasn't moved since the last edit.\r\nI had to google it to figure out what the command does.\r\n\r\n#### Reasoning:\r\n\r\nEven though the command also undo's selection changes and not just cursor movements, I think \"cursor\" is a general term the refers to both \"cursor\" and \"selection\".\r\n\r\nAlso, the command name itself is already \"cursorUndo\", it makes sense for the name in the command palette to use the same term.\r\n\r\nHaving \"cursor\" in the command's name will make it clear it undo's things that the cursor does, such as moving and selecting text.\r\nA user that will find this command in the command palette will most likely attempt to move the cursor and then use the command, and then will understand what it does.\r\n\r\n#### System Info:\r\n\r\nVSCode Version: 1.38.1\r\nOS:

calling http(s).request only with options the method and path are changed to wrong value.\r\n\r\nI've written simple example. \r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.38.1\r\n- OS Version: Ubuntu 19.04 and Windows 10 1903\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run this code.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst https = require('https');\r\nconst Url = require('url');\r\n\r\nconst applyUrlToOptions = (options, url) => {\r\n\r\n    options.host = url.host;\r\n    options.origin = url.origin;\r\n    options.searchParams = url.searchParams;\r\n    options.protocol = url.protocol;\r\n    options.hostname = url.hostname;\r\n    options.hash = url.hash;\r\n    options.search = url.search;\r\n    options.pathname = url.pathname;\r\n    options.path = `${url.pathname}${url.search || ''}`;\r\n    options.href = url.href;\r\n    if (url.port !== '') {\r\n        options.port = Number(url.port);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (url.username || url.password) {\r\n        options.auth = `${url.username}:${url.password}`;\r\n        options.username = url.username;\r\n        options.password = url.password;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return options;\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst testProxyResolver = (method, url, options) => {\r\n    const uri = {};\r\n    const parsedUri = new Url.URL(url);\r\n\r\n    applyUrlToOptions(uri, parsedUri);\r\n\r\n    uri.method = method.toUpperCase();\r\n    uri.headers = options.headers || {};\r\n    uri.headers.host = uri.host;\r\n    uri.headers['content-type'] = 'application/json';\r\n    uri.headers['content-length'] = options.payload.length;\r\n\r\n    return  https.request(uri);\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst data = testProxyResolver('POST', 'https://example.com', {payload: 'payload'});\r\n\r\ndata.agent = undefined; // to reduce output\r\n\r\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. In the console output will be the correct result of https.request\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"_events\": {},\r\n  \"_eventsCount\": 1,\r\n  \"output\": [],\r\n  \"outputEncodings\": [],\r\n  \"outputCallbacks\": [],\r\n  \"outputSize\": 0,\r\n  \"writable\": true,\r\n  \"_last\": true,\r\n  \"chunkedEncoding\": false,\r\n  \"shouldKeepAlive\": false,\r\n  \"useChunkedEncodingByDefault\": true,\r\n  \"sendDate\": false,\r\n  \"_removedConnection\": false,\r\n  \"_removedContLen\": false,\r\n  \"_removedTE\": false,\r\n  \"_contentLength\": null,\r\n  \"_hasBody\": true,\r\n  \"_trailer\": \"\",\r\n  \"finished\": false,\r\n  \"_headerSent\": false,\r\n  \"socket\": null,\r\n  \"connection\": null,\r\n  \"_header\": null,\r\n  \"method\": \"POST\",\r\n  \"path\": \"/\",\r\n  \"_ended\": false,\r\n  \"res\": null,\r\n  \"timeoutCb\": null,\r\n  \"upgradeOrConnect\": false,\r\n  \"parser\": null,\r\n  \"maxHeadersCount\": null\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Run the code above into vscode extension by the command from the palette \r\n4. The result will be wrong. Method and useChunkedEncodingByDefault properties are different.\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"_events\": {},\r\n  \"_eventsCount\": 1,\r\n  \"output\": [],\r\n  \"outputEncodings\": [],\r\n  \"outputCallbacks\": [],\r\n  \"outputSize\": 0,\r\n  \"writable\": true,\r\n  \"_last\": true,\r\n  \"chunkedEncoding\": false,\r\n  \"shouldKeepAlive\": false,\r\n  \"useChunkedEncodingByDefault\": false,\r\n  \"sendDate\": false,\r\n  \"_removedConnection\": false,\r\n  \"_removedContLen\": false,\r\n  \"_removedTE\": false,\r\n  \"_contentLength\": null,\r\n  \"_hasBody\": true,\r\n  \"_trailer\": \"\",\r\n  \"finished\": false,\r\n  \"_headerSent\": false,\r\n  \"socket\": null,\r\n  \"connection\": null,\r\n  \"_header\": null,\r\n  \"method\": \"GET\",\r\n  \"path\": \"/\",\r\n  \"_ended\": false,\r\n  \"res\": null,\r\n  \"timeoutCb\": null,\r\n  \"upgradeOrConnect\": false,\r\n  \"parser\": null,\r\n  \"maxHeadersCount\": null\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt seems like the error somewhere here:\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blame/d3eb24828e2d977e4f3ac16ff1a332a020028464/src/vs/workbench/services/extensions/node/proxyResolver.ts#L331\r\n\r\nIt seems like in the URL always is searchParams, and condition for URL will be forever false\r\n\r\nAlso, you can execute this function in the example project (attached file)\r\n1. Run in the folder with an example project to execute native https.request\r\n```\r\nnpm run test\r\n```\r\n2. Run the extension and choose command in palette\r\n```\r\nTest proxy resolver\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis issue occurs when all extensions are disabled\r\n\r\n\r\n[proxyresolver.zip](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/files/3693228/proxyresolver.zip)"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81998","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81998/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81998/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81998/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/81998","id":502957110,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MDI5NTcxMTA=","number":81998,"title":"Open terminal error - cannot type into node terminal","user":{"login":"zamird","id":55046458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDQ2NDU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/55046458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zamird","html_url":"https://github.com/zamird","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zamird/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zamird/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zamird/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zamird/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zamird/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zamird/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zamird/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zamird/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zamird/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODk0MjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"E2A1C2","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTMzMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTMzMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2019-10-05T12:27:03Z","updated_at":"2019-10-07T13:04:30Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nI opened a new node terminal, and tried to type into it.\r\n\r\n**Result:** \r\n1.

PR resolves #34330 by adding support for [git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt/), a tool which encrypts and decrypts files as a git filter.\r\n\r\nCurrently VS Code does not properly show diffs for files that are encrypted on the `remote` but decrypted locally.\r\n\r\nHere is some of the current behavior:\r\n\r\nA file will have no changes (see below that `production.yaml` doesn't show up in the `git status` panel) but will show in the editor that the whole file was modified:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/549323/66243607-0002cd80-e6ba-11e9-94ad-d827f300813c.png)\r\n\r\nWe can see here when bringing up the inline diffs, that it's comparing the decrypted local file with the encrypted `HEAD` version:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/549323/66243651-2a548b00-e6ba-11e9-9a6c-e4a5a5bfeb2a.png)\r\n\r\nLastly, when the file is changed (shown below as showing up in the `git status` on the panel), and the `git diff` is opened, the diff isn't shown because the left side is the binary version:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/549323/66243697-67208200-e6ba-11e9-8d08-48fe61039ced.png)\r\n\r\nThis PR is fairly simple, and doesn't attempt to solve the total scope of adding generic support for any and all filters. However, I hope this can get accepted in the meantime before that solution is realized to support this specific issue.\r\n\r\nThis PR checks after a `git show` to see if the buffer contains a [magic word](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt/blob/master/commands.cpp#L460) that indicates it is a `git-crypt` encrypted blob. If it is, then it runs it into `git-crypt smudge` which will decrypt the contents appropriately. This resolves all of the cases mentioned above.\r\n\r\nA potential implementation for solving the generic issue would be to read `.gitattributes` for the file being `git show`'d and see what the `filter` is and hand that as the program to execute the blob on. However, this would require significantly more testing which was out of scope for the work I'm doing."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81982","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81982/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81982/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81982/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/81982","id":502860495,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzI0ODYzMTU2","number":81982,"title":"Add git.showCommitInput config option (#79074)","user":{"login":"flurmbo","id":35127144,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTI3MTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/35127144?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flurmbo","html_url":"https://github.com/flurmbo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flurmbo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flurmbo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flurmbo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flurmbo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flurmbo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flurmbo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flurmbo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flurmbo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flurmbo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":296835379,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTY4MzUzNzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/git","name":"git","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2019-10-04T21:55:26Z","updated_at":"2019-10-07T10:27:42Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/pulls/81982","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/81982","diff_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/81982.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/81982.patch"},"body":"Adds feature requested in #79074.\r\n\r\nTo implement this, I mostly followed the pattern for the 'git.branchSortOrder' option and used VS Code's SourceControl API to toggle visibility of the input box.

comments.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15098499/66222541-029ffb80-e697-11e9-9b59-d96362a4a836.png)\r\n\r\nI'm sure you can tell the bottom right block are comments. But did you know the top block also are?\r\n\r\nYes, I know, I could pick a color that more closely resembles the grey I'm after without using transparency. And that works out great. But from a theme creators perspective, not being able to use font transparency really cuts down on your ability to easily tweak things and make scalable systems of color."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81970","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81970/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81970/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81970/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/81970","id":502722309,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MDI3MjIzMDk=","number":81970,"title":"VSCode won't launch on mac","user":{"login":"darzu","id":6453828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTM4Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6453828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/darzu","html_url":"https://github.com/darzu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darzu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darzu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darzu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darzu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darzu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darzu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darzu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darzu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darzu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODk0MjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"E2A1C2","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMDY5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMDY5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2019-10-04T16:08:52Z","updated_at":"2019-10-05T16:39:09Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.38.1 \"b37e54c98e1a74ba89e03073e5a3761284e3ffb0 x64\"\r\n- OS Version: MacOS 10.14.6 (18G103)\r\n\r\nFor the last couple weeks (I wish I could be more precise, although I know it first happened sometime within the last two months), my laptop gets into a state where it can no longer launch VSCode from the command line or app icon. This happens most days. There are three separate work arounds that I have found (listed below), however each of these only works temporarily, inevitably I end up in this broken state again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce (icon):\r\n1. Click on \"Visual Studio Code\" app icon\r\n2. Nothing happens, no window appears, no dot appears by the icon\r\nSteps to Reproduce (command line):\r\n1. Run \"code .\" in some folder in my user directory\r\n2. Nothing happens, no window appears, no dot appears by the icon\r\n\r\nIf I launch with \"--verbose\" I see:\r\n```\r\n~/mc/pxt(master=) $ code --verbose\r\n[main 2019-10-04T15:38:02.271Z] Sending env to running instance...\r\n[main 2019-10-04T15:38:02.277Z] Sent env to running instance. Terminating...\r\n[main 2019-10-04T15:38:02.277Z] Lifecycle#kill()\r\n```\r\nIf I launch with \"--verbose --disable-gpu\" (which doesn't fix the issue) I see:\r\n```\r\n~/mc/pxt(dazuniga/docs_header *=) $ code --disable-gpu --verbose\r\n[20394:1004/083920.476724:ERROR:gpu_process_transport_factory.cc(1017)] Lost UI shared context.\r\n[main 2019-10-04T15:39:20.568Z] Sending env to running instance...\r\n[main 2019-10-04T15:39:20.572Z] Sent env to running instance. Terminating...\r\n[main 2019-10-04T15:39:20.572Z] Lifecycle#kill()\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoing any of the following will **temporarily** fix the issue:\r\n1. launch with the \"--user-data-dir ~\" command line option. VSCode will open fine. I'm not running vscode from any remote location or using sudo however.\r\n2. Rebooting my laptop. When I reboot, vscode will launch again, but inevitably I get into this broken state again within a day or so.\r\n3. If I search for \"Electron\" processes and kill them all:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6453828/66221703-71278e00-e684-11e9-87ef-a86ed61d3de7.png)\r\nthen vscode will launch again.\r\nEdit: Actually, after kill these electron processes vscode will start but none of my keyboard strokes are making into the window. Keycords don't work and I can't type in buffers.\r\n\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes\r\n\r\nThe most recent time this happened is this morning. Last night my laptop died because it ran out of power, and I then charged it over night and opened it this morning. As MacOS does, it restored all the windows and processes I had running before it died from low-power. There were likely vscode windows running when my laptop ran out of power. My suspicion is that macos brought back some subset of resources vscode needs when it restored my state after regaining power, but somehow this left vscode in an inoperable state."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81968","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81968/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81968/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81968/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/81968","id":502683650,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MDI2ODM2NTA=","number":81968,"title":"Problems: badge does not seem centered","user":{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMDY5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"sandy081","id":10746682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzQ2Njgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10746682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081","html_url":"https://github.com/sandy081","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"sandy081","id":10746682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzQ2Njgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10746682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081","html_url":"https://github.com/sandy081","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2019-10-04T14:54:27Z","updated_at":"2019-10-07T10:01:32Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"See problems entry when selection is on (macOS):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/900690/66217433-938ecb00-e6c7-11e9-92ae-3121fc119f34.png)\r\n"}]
