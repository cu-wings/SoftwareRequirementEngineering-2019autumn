Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a [\"definitions\"](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/structuring.html) member for a JSON schema, and put a subschema there.\r\n2. Attempt to refer to this subschema in `settings.json`.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI'm in a folder called \"json\" with a subfolder called \"schemas\" with the schemas, and a subfolder called \".vscode\" for the `settings.json`.\r\n\r\nHere is the definitions schema I am using:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"$schema\": \"https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/schema\",\r\n  \"type\": \"object\",\r\n  \"definitions\": {\r\n    \"items\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"array\",\r\n      \"items\": {\r\n        \"$ref\": \"items.json#\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"minItems\": 1\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I just make `items.json` into an array and use `\"url\": \"./schemas/items.json\"` works fine, but that isn't very conducive to my current work case. \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo I tried using this:\r\n```\r\n\"schema\": {\r\n\t\"type\": \"array\",\r\n\t\"items\": {\r\n\t  \"$ref\": \"./schemas/items.json\"\r\n\t}\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nGot this error: \"Problems loading reference 'vscode://schemas/custom/schemas/items.json': Request vscode/content failed with message: cannot open vscode://schemas/custom/schemas/items.json. Detail: resource is not available\".\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTried using this:\r\n`\"url\": \"file:///C:/Users/BLATANT-DOXX-RISK/Source/Repos/json/schemas/types.json#/definitions/items\"`\r\n\r\nAnd it just used `types.json`, ignored the definitions part, and looked for nothing but a blank object.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFinally, I tried using this: `\"url\": \"./schemas/types.json#/definitions/items\"`.\r\n\r\nGot this error: \"File not found (c:\\Users\\BLATANT-DOXX-RISK\\Source\\Repos\\json\\schemas\\types.json#\\definitions\\items))\".\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n@aeschli came up a *lot* when looking through Github issues.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nVS

Prepare the following tasks. `parent` has no command, only depends on `echo`.\r\n```\r\n    \"tasks\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"label\": \"echo\",\r\n            \"type\": \"shell\",\r\n            \"command\": \"echo Hello\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"label\": \"parent\",\r\n            \"dependsOn\": [\"echo\"]\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n```\r\n2. Use `vscode.tasks.fetchTasks()` to get tasks then execute `parent`. `vscode.tasks.taskExecutions` now contains 2 instances, one for `echo`, one for `parent`.\r\n3. Once `echo` is completed (`parent` should be completed too since there is nothing left to do), check `vscode.tasks.taskExecutions`.\r\n\r\n**Expected**:\r\n`vscode.tasks.taskExecutions` should be empty.\r\n\r\n**Actual**:\r\n`vscode.tasks.taskExecutions` still contains an instance for `parent`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes/No\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81775","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81775/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81775/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/81775/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/81775","id":501026072,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MDEwMjYwNzI=","number":81775,"title":"Chords don't work when webview editor is focused","user":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTMzMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODIxOTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODIxOTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2019-10-01T17:02:40Z","updated_at":"2019-10-01T18:07:23Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"#81698\r\n\r\nWindows\r\n\r\n1.
