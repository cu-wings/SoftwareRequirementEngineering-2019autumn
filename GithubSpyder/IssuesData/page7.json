watch the whole user home directory, but code/User folder under user home directory. code/User folder is the one created by VS Code for storing above user data.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI Propose here to add a extra RTC Channel for Settings File Updates to call a reread of a settings file\r\nso on save of a settings file we simply emit a event to that channel and vscode will reread its configuration this saves a ton of filewatchers.\r\n\r\nwe should also add a reload vscode

This is, because all touch gestures are interpreted as scrolling and not as selecting.\r\n\r\nI looked what Notepad++ does. This is very interesting. Notepad++ works differently depending on what direction the touch swiping starts. If it starts vertically (up/down) then ist is scrolling and if it starte horizontally (left/right) it is selecting. - It should be noted, that even if you start moving the finger up or down for scrolling, if the scrolling has started you still can scroll left or right. If you are in selection mode (left/right movement) you can also select up and down. So the application looks how the movement started. This is a really cool and accassible way of using touch in this program.\r\n\r\nVisual Studio code should work in a similar way.\r\n\r\n(PS: This whole way of using with touch reminds me of the clever way Tiles worked Windows 8. Unfortunately Microsoft forgot about that, when they switched scrolling direction of Tiles in Windows 10.)\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.38.1 (b37e54c98e1a74ba89e03073e5a3761284e3ffb0,

textModelResolverService: ITextModelService\r\n  ) { }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is currently possible to use the instantiation service to create an instance of `MyService` that passes `undefined` for

Overview\r\n\r\nLanguages like Razor (and I imagine HTML for custom attributes) typically have scenarios where portions of the document are semantically a different language.\r\n\r\nIn Razor this happens frequently through the use of TagHelpers or in Blazor:\r\n```Razor\r\n<form asp-antiforgery=\"ViewBag.ShouldRenderAntiforgery\">\r\n...\r\n</form>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example we'd expect that `ViewBag.ShouldRenderAntiforgery` would be C#. The way TagHelpers (things that apply to HTML and change the semantic language of the right hand side of an attribute) can be customized by users is limitless so we need to have full control over telling the IDE what things are C# and what things aren't.\r\n\r\n## Ideas on how to implement\r\n\r\nOver in the [issue ](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/77133) where the discussion of general semantic colorization the proposal was to have an API similar to:\r\n\r\n```TypeScript\r\ninterface SemanticHighlightRangeProvider {\r\n   provideHighlightRanges(doc,...): [ Range, TokenType, TokenModifier[] ][];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe proposed approach can also be used to enable semantic language colorization without enabling an entire language's extensions for a subset of a document.\r\n\r\nTo do this one could expand on the `ThemeDefinition` and add a `language` parameter:\r\n```TypeScript\r\ninterface TokenStyle {\r\n   foreground?: Color | ColorFunction\r\n   style?: bold | italic | underline\r\n   language?: string\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis would enable LanguageServers to mark a chunk of text in an editor as a Token that associates with a specific language. This would work similarly to how tooltips/completion descriptions etc. work when specifying pieces of text that should be colorized as a certain language.\r\n\r\nSo in the first example `asp-antiforgery=\"ViewBag.ShouldRenderAntiforgery\"` Razor's language server would indicate that the entire `ViewBag.ShouldRenderAntiforgery` was of a Razor specific theme that had a token Style of:\r\n```JSON\r\n{\r\n    \"language\": \"csharp\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis would enable future scenarios where if Razor wanted to go above and beyond to provide semantic colorization of specific tokens it could do it in an additive fashion on top of existing theme."}]
